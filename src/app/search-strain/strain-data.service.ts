However extra care should be taken outdoors as this is a sensitive plant, so problems with weather, bugs or irrigation will harm your final harvest.</p>\n<p>The only down side with Amnesia haze is the long flower time required of 12 weeks. Although this is high enough to make most commercial growers run for the hills, true cannabis connoisseurs will find the wait more than worth it. Amnesia Haze is suitable for both hydro and soil grows, sea/screen of green too.</p>\n<p>Every hit comes with a truly psychedelic head high, likely to send any user straight into the astrosphere.

This Indica dominant plant is short-stacked, with little stretching, growing almost like bonsai or broccoli. It can grow just over 1 m tall but we advise growers to either pinch or top the plant to produce more of a bushy plant.</p>\n<p>Since it will not grow much vertically, bushing the volume of the plant sideways can give better results for yield. We also recommend a week longer than normal in veg with Blue Mystic, again to maximise the yield. Normally, it will do 55-65 g per plant indoors. On average, thatâ€™s about 400-500 g per square metre under a 600w light. Outdoors, it needs the warmth of the Mediterranean or California and does not do well in northern Europe.</p>\n<p>Blue Mystic Feminized can be ready for harvest after 8 weeks, giving it a vibrant sweet taste of fresh fruit. If given a little longer (up to 10 weeks), it will lose some flavour but pay you back with a heavier body stoned effect. As always, we recommend drying your plants before manicuring the buds, but itâ€™s especially recommended with Blue Mystic to bring about the full flavour of this plant.</p>\n<p>If captured correctly, the flavour of Blue Mystic should be so sweet and refreshing as to give the smoker an actual taste of drinking juice. This intense flavour is equally matched with a super potent Indica stone that leaves users physically locked-down.</p>"

            "description": "<p>Kush is to Indica varieties what Haze means to Sativa. Much like skunk, kush is a term which can be used to describe a whole lineage of cannabis plants. We use the term Indica today to describe a type of plant which is found naturally (indigenous to) in the India Region. At that time all plants were called Cannabis Sativa, but there was something very different about these varieties which required discrimination into another category, named Indica due to the region where they were first discovered.</p>\n<p>We decided to resurrect one of these old school Kush strains by bringing it into the modern era with a feminized only seed. Special Kush is our lowest-price seed, perfect for the budget grower. If youâ€™re looking for some decent smoke without the heavy price tag, Special Kush is perfect for you.</p>\n<p>Special Kush likes to grow wild as if in the mountains of Afghanistan; this means it will fill up any space it can. Indoors, care should be taken that it doesnâ€™t overgrow its space, but given enough space, like outdoors, it can grow to over 3 m tall. It will be finished flowering in 7-8 weeks and can yield about 65-150 g per plant indoors, 475 g per square metre under a 600w light. Grown outdoors, it needs that warm environment such as can be found in Italy or North Africa. With enough sun, food and water, this tree can yield over 550 g per plant.</p>\n<p>Generally, the buds from Special Kush are small and tight nuggets of frosty goodness which are spread all over the plant. The smoke carries a very hash-like taste with a full body stone present from its Indica background. This is a simple and basic plant, with good smoke, available in a feminized seed for a low price.</p>"

Perfect for a first-time grower who doesn't want to invest too much in his experimental growing. This Special Queen is a classic skunk that grows with ease, doesn't stretch too much and can be harvested in 8 weeks.</p>\n<p>Indoors it will grow to 1.4 m, so it will need a little more room. Outdoors this marijuana plant will grow to over 3 m. It needs lots of good sun but is also suitable for northern European climates like in the Netherlands or Great Britain. A sativa dominant strain, its buds are spread out all over the plant, providing an excellent yield for an 8 week sativa.</p>\n<p>Indoors, Special Queen feminized will yield about 500g per square metre under a 600W light. Outdoors, this plant will grow big and strong and can yield over 550 g per plant. Care should be given to provide it with all the nutrients and water it will need to grow big and strong, while making sure not to give it too much.</p>\n<p>This Cannabis strain is relatively easy to grow with little maintenance, making it a suitable contender for those commercial crops. Perfect in both hydro and soil set ups, Special Queen is well-suited for the sea/screen of green operations. We recommend 8 weeks flowering for this Cannabis strain; however some growers have harvested as early as week 7.</p>\n<p>The smoke from Special Queen feminized is that of a classic skunk stone. Mostly mental, Special Queen provides smokers with an uplifting high that will relax even the most anxious stoners.</p>"

            "description": "<p>Cheese is a legendary cannabis plant with origins based in the UK. This marijuana strain has its heritage from some original Skunk #1 that was rediscovered then developed by a dedicated crew of cannabis growers from London. Finally they gave birth to a skunk that was so stinky that there seemed no more fitting a name than Cheese.</p>\n<p>Royal Cheese Feminized will grow to about 1 metre indoors, but will stretch to 2.0 metres out in the sun. This marijuana strain loves to drink and will grow big and strong as a result. The biggest issue encountered when growing Royal Cheese Feminized is the smell. This cannabis plant stinks so much that a carbon filter is almost essential for indoors, while everyone in the immediate radius will smell it outside.</p>\n<p>Grown indoors, Royal Cheese will yield on average 60 grams per plant or 450-550 grams per square metre. Outdoors, this plant will tower above everything else and can yield over 600 grams in the correct climate (Spain, Italy, and California). It can be grown outdoors in northern Europe too, but will produce a lower quality buds than if grown indoors.</p>\n<p>Royal Cheese from Royal Queen Seeds can be harvested 8 weeks after flowering to achieve the strongest flavour. Leaving it 2 weeks longer, 10 weeks, will give less flavour but will pack more of a punch. Different growers enjoy different effects so it's up to you personally to experiment which is the right time for you; however, as a general rule, Cheese can be harvested at 8 weeks.</p>\n<p>The effect from Cheese is quite simply fantastic; carrying such a strong, pungent aroma which follows through with a good flavour.</p>"

Being a sativa dominant plant, it will grow big and strong throughout the flowering period. Indoors it can reach 2 metres, outdoors in the sun it will grow to over 3 metres tall. It grows exactly as you would expect a sativa to, with long stretchy branches, and lots of buds all over.</p>\n<p>The size of Royal Moby during its growth is rewarded with the yield that can be harvested. Indoor growers can expect 75 g per plant or 600 g per square metre under a 600w light. Grown outdoors it needs lots of sun, like along the Mediterranean; however, it can also be grown in extremely hot, tropical environments. In these conditions, these 3 m tall plants can grow up to 1000 g per plant. In both cases, indoors/outdoors, Royal Moby likes to grow big and will need lots of good nourishment to help it.</p>\n<p>The only Indica trait to carry through in this hybrid is a short flowering period of 9-10 weeks. For commercial growers who can afford a little more time and room, Royal Moby is the perfect option for those willing to make a sacrifice for a better smoke. The high that comes from smoking this is beyond astronomical, a pure psychedelic experience. Royal Moby is amongst the strongest THC-bearing cannabis plants we sell, and it's truly felt with every smoke of a joint or bong.</p>"

            "description": "<p>This is our feminised auto-flowering version of the famous Blueberry, known worldwide for its sweet berry flavour and aroma. We already had a great version of this plant in our Blue Mystic but now we have an auto-flowering variety to give you even more choice.</p>\n\n<p>We crossed our auto-flowering strains with the best genetics from the Blue Family, the classic cross of Thailand races, Thai hybrids and an old school Afghan bred by legendary breeders in California and Oregon. This produced our Royal Bluematic. Thanks to the auto-flowering genetics, this plant is now easier to grow and you can harvest just 8 to 9 weeks after planting the seeds.</p>\n\n<p>Royal Bluematic grows to a medium-to-tall height for an auto-flowering variety, averaging around 60-75 cm. Like most auto-flowering varieties, it will grow very few side branches and dedicates all its energy to producing one large main bud. It will produce on average around 120 g per plant.</p>\n\n<p>Due to its mostly Indica genetics, Royal Bluematic has a smooth, relaxing stoned effect. The flavour is much like our Blue Mystic, a sweet smell and blueberry-like taste. It is an easy plant to grow, with a good taste and effect; the perfect combination.</p>"

Generally, it will not grow any taller than 50 to 60 cm. If grown well, it can yield up to 150 g per plant, and some growers have achieved even more. The plants have a fresh, herbal, almost citrus-like aroma. The taste is mild but good, and comes with a pleasant physically stoned effect.</p>"

Others say that itâ€™s just a special cutting of ChemDawg from the early 90s. Even the meaning of the name OG has been debated; with some saying it means Original Gangster. However, now, because of its origins, most people agree it means Ocean Grown.</p>\n<p>One thing that is not debated is the popularity of this feminized cannabis strain. From Hollywood movie stars and rappers to medical marijuana users, OG Kush is loved by many. The most obvious trait of OG Kush is its strong, unique, very dank, slightly citrus aroma, almost like fuel or strong detergent. The flavour of OG Kush is equally as strong and dank, with a long-lasting aftertaste.</p>\n<p>OG Kush is an extremely strong cannabis strain, with most experienced smokers listing it as one of their favourites. The effect is as strong physically as it is mentally. Though its effect is like an Sativa, the strain's genetics are mostly Indica. The effect is as strong and complex as the flavour. OG Kush takes around 8 weeks to flower and on average the yield is 65 grams per plant.</p>\n<p>OG Kush is known to stretch slightly during growth but soon starts to fill out during flowering. Generally, it will reach a height of 90 to 160 cm. Its buds are large and dense, lime green clusters covered with a large amount of resin. There are many good reasons why OG Kush has become so popular. Now available as a feminized variety from Royal Queen Seeds, so you can try out this amazing strain yourself.</p>"

Leaf to bud ratio is pretty good, though some pruning might be required. Her flowering period is within the minimum lever set for sativas; it takes this cannabis just 10 weeks to start producing medium sized nodes full of generous trichomes; THC content is said to be as high as 18-20%.<br />Medicine produced from Tikal sativa plants have lower CBD and higher THC counts which produce a very powerful, long-lasting and therapeutic effect.

            "description": "<p>ACE Seeds Orient Express&nbsp; is a potent F1 marijuana hybrid from Ace Seeds industry whose breeders combined the high production of aromatic and resinous flowers of a Vietnam Black mother with the low height and short flowering time of a Yunnan Chinese indica. This cannabis strain is sativa dominated and shows characteristics typical for sativas, except, maybe, the height. Ace seed selectors did their best and created a petite Asian lady perfect for indoor and outdoor cultivation. Her size doesn't exceed 130 cm, the plants developed from Orient Express seeds, are column like with more buds sites than on an indica. The buds are somehow less dense, however, the final product is of an incredible quality. THC content is said to be between 14 and 16%, giving a cerebral sativa effect, less strong on the body and with a more pronounced effect on the brain, where it goes from a creative feeling to a trippy one according to the power.<br /><br />Orient Express has a compact structure with good branching. After a short flowering, which lasts only 9 weeks, she goes into a quick bud maturing phase. A deep and organic marijuana aroma appears from the beginning of her flowering. Smoking is muddy flavoured with floral details.<br />All cannabis seeds selected and bred by Ace Seeds industry are specially designed for indoor and outdoor cultivation. They are very resistant to diseases and cope well with any climate surprises, warm or cold. This cannabis variety can bring a variety to your marijuana gardens and is highly recommended to anyone who likes Asian flavours</p>"

The result is a plant with a great vegetative strength, remarkable for its overpowering potency and its exceptional floral traits. The flower bunches flare over forming dense buds with small leaves.

Dance World will have a yield of around 400 to 450 grams per plant.</p>\n<p>The smell is not too strong during growth or flowering.

Originally bred over 20 years ago, this powerful strain has a strong, almost overwhelming, lemon fuel flavour. Growers will love this strain, both for its compact, dense growth and its generous yields. Indoors, 450-500 grams per square metre, grown under a 600 watt HPS, are easily produced. It is a heavy feeder so it can happily absorb strong bloom boosters and nutrients.</p>\n\n<p>Though it can be a bit more difficult to grow, the plant tends to like lower humidity levels, as it can be at risk of bud rot, mould or powdery mildew. This, however, is mainly due to its heavy, dense buds â€“ so as long as you take care with the plant, it is more than worth the extra attention. It responds well to cropping and trimming and we advise you not to let it grow too tall during vegetative growth as the plant tends to stretch during the first few weeks of flowering. Flowering takes around 8 to 10 weeks, with around 9 being the average.</p>"

A three-way cross between BlueBlack, Maple Leaf Indica and White Rhino, this is one beautiful, complex and strong plant that shows clear signs of hybrid vigour.</p>\n<p>After flowering starts, Honey Cream Fast Version (formerly Royal Caramel) will be ready to harvest in 7 to 8 weeks, but don&rsquo;t rush &ndash; let it mature fully and you will be rewarded with a potent harvest. Indoors, it will normally yield around 500 grams per square metre. Experienced growers may even achieve up to 650 grams per metre. Outdoors, it will be ready in September and will yield around the same per plant, depending on the climate and conditions.</p>\n<p>Honey Cream has an intense, sweet sugary, almost caramel-like aroma. The flavour, while not as sweet as the aroma, is sweet and almost earthy. Due to its complex genetics, a variety of tastes and smells can come from these plants, but the sweet, creamy caramel aroma overpowers all.</p>\n<p>It grows like a classic Indica &ndash; short and bushy, with a huge flowering top of dense, resinous buds. The effect, as you would expect from such an Indica, is a heavy and relaxing. Perfect for relaxation, some medicinal users have found benefits for various physical ailments. All of this makes Honey Cream a great strain for Indica lovers.</p>\n<p>Now with a Faster Flowering time than before!</p>"

            "description": "Royal Queen Seeds are proud to add this fine cannabis strain to their selection. This might be one of the most famous strains of cannabis on the planet; and maybe one of the strongest.\n \nLike many of the best cannabis strains coming out these days, Sour Diesel comes straight from California. It is one of the  favourite strains amongst many. These powerful American genetics will grow well indoors around the world; outdoors, on the other hand, they need a warm climate, similar to California or Spain.\n \nThis is a mostly Sativa strain which shows in both its growth structure and the strong effect. The plant develops its resinous buds and powerful aroma over a 10-week flowering period. This is after a recommended 3-to-4 week vegetative period. These plants will grow to a height of around 100-160 cm. indoors, with some stretching during early flowering.\n \nSour Diesel is a very pungent, aromatic strain. Heavy chemical, herbal and sour flavours come from its glistening buds. When grown well, it will give yields of 450-600 grams per square metre. This is both a yield in quantity and quality, producing high-quality, resinous, aromatic buds. Full Diesel power!"

The original Amnesia, aka Amnesia Haze, Champagne Haze, The Bomb, Ultra Haze and many others names, is a classic Sativa strain that's popular worldwide.</p> \n<p>The biggest downside of Sativa strains like Amnesia is that it can take a while to flower, 12 weeks on average, but some pheno-types can take up 20 weeks. She can also grow quite tall; this can be another issue for some with limited space. The Amnesia Haze Automatic aims to solve these problems. Offering the same euphoric high and spicy, sweet taste as the original Amnesia but with a heavily reduced growth time and a much smaller height.</p> \n<p>Indoors, she will take around 80 days from seed to bud. In this time she can grow quite large, especially when compared to other auto-flowering strains. This is a clear sign of her Sativa dominant genetics - tall plants, large thin leaves and long stretching buds. The Amnesia Haze Automatic is a vigorous plant that can grow to heights of around 80-150 cm. This large Sativa dominant auto-flowering strains, much like the original Amnesia, gives generous yields of high quality hazey buds. She likes to be fed well, but be careful not to over feed her, as like as Hazes she can be sensitive to nutrients.</p> \n<p>After 80 days of growth and flowering you will be left with a good yield, around 40 grams on average and up to 150 grams in ideal conditions. She gives long, fox tail like buds with a sweet, spicy, musky aroma. All in all she has the classic Amnesia aroma, flavour and effect. The Amnesia Haze Automatic is the perfect auto-flowering variety for lovers of the Haze.</p>"

He was a tireless Cannabis legalisation activist and author of the book The Emperor Wears No Clothes, also called the Hemp Bible. He was a powerful voice in the Cannabis movement up until his death in 2010. The Jack Herer strain is equally powerful, a strong Sativa dominant with an uplifting high and a fresh peppery aroma.\n \nJack Herer Automatic grows buds that are very similar to the original Jack Herer. However, as this strain is autoflowering, it can be grown almost anywhere. The plants will grow quickly and be ready to harvest in around 10 weeks.\n \nThe main effect is an uplifting and creative Sativa high, but thanks to Jack Herer's mix of Haze, Northern Lights and Skunk, this strain also gives you a relaxing Indica feeling. Jack Herer Automatic has a Haze-like, peppery aroma.\n \nJack Herer Automatic will perform well in both indoor and outdoor grows, giving an average yield of around 40 to 70 grams per plant. It will not grow too tall, reaching an average height of 40 to 90 cm, which makes it ideal for smaller space. Royal Queen Seeds is proud to carry on the tribute to Jack Herer, the Emperor of Hemp, with this great autoflowering strain."

The White Widow Automatic has a sweet and sour, citrus-like aroma and taste, similar to but not as strong as White Widow. This strain was bred for a few years to ensure stability in the genetics. Indoors it will grow to an average height of around 50 cm, with some larger plants reaching 100 cm.

Aptly named for it's bright white trichomes, white widow is \"frosty\" or \"crystally\" in appearance.\n\nThis potent strain is a beautiful representation of the indica-dominant hybrid originating from quality cannabis breeding in Amsterdam.\n\nWhite Widow originated by crossing a \"Brazilian sativa land-race\" with a \"resin-heavy south Indian indica\".\n\nThis is the mastery of cannabis breeding and genetics in the direction of potency, not flavor. These two genetic traits, landrace sativa, and heavy-resin indica were chosen primarily for their abilities to get a user \"high\".\n\nFor this reason, White Widow is without a doubt one of the most successful commercialized cannabis strains on the market.\n\nBuy White Widow seeds from Seedsman today and experience the very best in strain potency and cultivation efficiency."

For the first time this strain provided growers with the good taste and high of a sativa coupled with the quick heavy flowering of an indica. Having been successfully stabilized, Skunk No. 1 has been widely used as a breeding parent for most of today&rsquo;s leading \"skunk\" and many other strains. It is very easy to grow and has always been seen as a standard against which others can be measured.  It produces dense buds varying in colour from light green to golden with a very high yield. It is easy to manicure due to its high bud-to-leaf ratio. It has a sweet smell and taste with a cerebral high.</p>"

Over all she is quite an easy plant to maintain, with little stretching during flower for a Sativa, combined with her big bud structure altogether making her a pleasant plant to grow.  This relatively easy maintenance makes her suitable for both soil and hydro set ups, especially for Sea/Screen of Green operations. \n\nGrown indoors on average you get a yield of 65-75 g per plant or between 500 per m2. Grown outdoors, she prefers a warmer climate such as in Spain, Italy or California and given the right conditions will produce over 100g per plant. Due to her relatively short flower time she can be grown in more northern latitudes (UK, Netherlands), however, will not reach her full potential as she would indoors.  \n\nFlowering will be finished after 7-8 weeks to maximise flavour, but she can go a week longer to give an extra kick. Overall her short flower time, easy grow and big yield makes her a contender for the selection of those commercial â€˜cash-cropsâ€™.\n\nSweet, fruit like aroma."

The sweet, fruity Cheese aroma starts to develop just a few weeks after the start of flowering and continues to develop and intensify as the plant matures. Most plants will reach a height of around 80 to 140 cm. When grown outdoors she can grow a little taller and will be ready for harvest at the end of September.</p>\n\n<p>Good growers will find they get equally good yields - you can expect an easy average of 500 to 550 grams per square metre. The only down side of Blue Cheese is the slightly above average leaf-to-flower ratio, meaning she will be a little harder to trim. However this little bit of extra work more than pays off on the end product. Blue Cheese performs extremely well in sea of green techniques as well as with both hydroponic and soil based methods of growing.</p>\n\n<p>The flavour of this strain is the perfect blend of its parentâ€™s genetics.

            "description": "<p>With Bubble Kush feminized seeds from Royal Queen Seeds, you&rsquo;ll be able to produce some amazing plants that taste great and yield fantastic growth results.</p>\n<p>Bubble Kush is an 80% Indica and 20% Sativa blend, and is 19% THC in total, making for the perfect natural high feeling. If you are looking for a perfect daydream relaxation in your own thoughts, this strain is the perfect option for you.</p>\n<p>If you decide to grow this plant indoors, you can expect to get a yield of 550-600 grams per plant.

In comparison to some other stains, this is a solid sized plant that will produce plenty of green for you to enjoy.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to have your growth outdoors, the best time to plan a harvest is at the end of September. Outdoor growths can expect to yield 600-650 grams per dried plant and range from 160-200 cm in height. Consider the weather, so that you can assure growth will not be affected due to changing temperatures.</p>\n<p>This strain of kush is one of the biggest yielders when it comes to growth. It is likely due to the attention paid by Royal Queen Seeds when combining two of the most powerful strains of cannabis on the market. However, the only thing that might be bigger than the plant itself, is the effect you can expect to have after enjoying this plant.</p>\n<p>Because it is so heavily indica dominant, this is considered a couch-lock cannabis strain as it will relax your body and mind. Bubble Kush is also great for those that are looking for pain management, or relief from depression or insomnia.</p>\n<p>In terms of its physical appearance, expect Bubble Kush to produce large buds with dark greens and strands of red hairs throughout. Fresher Bubble Kush will also have huge visible crystals throughout. And when the plant is in growth, expect large and beautiful plants that can become quite copious during harvest.</p>\n<p>If you have ever enjoyed the parents of this strain, then you are sure to like this new Bubble Kush Feminized. Not only do the seeds yield enough for you to get plenty of plant to harvest, but it also provides a fantastic finished product. Be sure to give this sweet, earthy, pungent plant a try for something new and enjoyable.</p>"

            "description": "<p>This variety was bred to incorporate the best elements of all strains to create a plant that is both easy to cultivate and presents a fantastic product. This strain has a pleasantly sweet taste with subtly earthy undertones and a strong, stony, positive effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Bubble Gum</strong><br />From its origins in Indiana to its later development in the Netherlands, this world-famous indica strain has developed notoriety for its easy-going yet soaring effect. The distinctive sweet taste and smell of this award-winning cannabis contributes to the similarly idiosyncratic yet pleasing sweet flavour of Bubble Kush Automatic.</p>\n<p><strong>OG Kush</strong><br />This exceedingly popular strain has qualities of both indica and sativa, and its intense and long-lasting effects have played no small part in the variety's fame throughout the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Royal Critical Automatic</strong><br />Royal Critical Automatic is popular with growers due its exceptionally quick and easy growing process and large per-plant yields. <br /><br />As far as growing is concerned, these seeds are autoflowering. Unlike traditional feminized seeds, such as traditional Bubba Kush and Bubble Kush Feminized seeds, growers do not have to worry about making sure the plants get 12 hours of direct light a day. Thanks to the ruderalis elements of this strain's genetics, these plants flower on their own within about five to seven weeks, just like other seeds such as Bubble Gum Automatic or Bubba Kush Automatic, both of which are similarly beloved by growers for yield and ease of growing.</p>\n<p>When growing outdoors, Bubble Kush Automatic is ready for harvest in seven to eight weeks. Indoors, fully grown plants are 70 to 100 centimetres high, and outdoors the height ranges from 100 to 140 centimeters. Growers can expect a healthy yield of 120 to 170 grams per outdoor plant after drying.</p>\n<p>Once harvested, this variety packs a wallop with 16 percent THC. The dominant effect reported with this strain is a sense of euphoria, with many users noting this variety's usefulness for stress release. Since this cannabis is genetically 60 percent indica, typical incida effects are also present including increased appetite and physical relaxation. Some insomniacs find this strain useful as a sleep aid, but the well-rounded high does not leave users feeling overwhelmingly lethargic or drowsy.</p>\n<p>These hardy seeds are ideal for growers who desire a fast growing and automatically flowering plant that does not require the same effort as more traditional feminized seeds. This hybrid strain is continuing to earn fans not only for its straightforward growing process but also its agreeable taste and robust effects.</p>"

            "description": "<p>Euphoria CBD is a superior blend of selective heredity between the popular cannabis strains of Royal Medic and Shark Shock. Royal Medic is a strain of cannabis that owes the majority of its genetics to the Juanita la Lagrimosa and is recognized as one of the high CBD strains and those genetics have been passed on to Euphoria. Shark Shock is a strain that has been a flourishing champion of the High Times Cannabis Cup since the late 1990s and it is a tremendously hardy grower. You will find those qualities are ever present in the Euphoria strain.</p>\n<p>CBD is an abbreviation for cannabidiol, which is often great for combating medical conditions such as Crohn's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis. Those who suffer from medical conditions that induce pain and discomfort, often turn to strains of cannabis that are known to be higher in CBD. Euphoria inherited this high CBD and contains more CBD than it does THC but, the percentages are pretty close at 7% and 6% respectively.</p>\n<p>Euphoria CBD's genetic background thoroughly infuses this strain of Euphoria with a sweet and particularly fruity scent that continues on into the taste for quite a pleasant aroma. Being that it is 20 percent Sativa and 80 percent Indica, there is more of a euphoric mood that does not encourage sleepiness but is great for pain and nervous tension relief. This makes for great medical remedy. It is a short to average size plant reaching heights outdoors of 100 to 140 cm. With indoor heights established at 60 to 100 cm, due to the high percentage of Indica which are in general, shorter and stockier plants.</p>\n<p>The yield produced by this plant is quite nice from the Indica structure. You will time and again find indoor and outdoor yields of 400 to as much as 450 grams per dried plant with no more than an 8 week flowering period! Not bad for medical marijuana, especially when you might find competitor strains taking as long as 10 weeks to flower!</p>\n<p>Euphoria is certainly one of the CBD strains. These are known to produce anti-anxiety and even anti-inflammatory reactions to those who use it. This is without having to endure a heavy couched or locked down feeling that is associated with some competitor strains. Anytime levels of CBD are found to be over 4%, this is considered to be a high amount. Euphoria, contains 7% CBD.</p>"

            "description": "<p>Generally, even strains that combine a Sativa and an Indica background tend to lean heavily towards one side or the other in both genetic background and effect. However, Candy Kush Express FAST Version is unique even amongst Indica/Sativa hybrids: at 40 percent sativa and 60 percent Indica, this Kush strain is about as close to a true, evenly mixed hybrid that there is available. This translates to a unique blend of both Indica and Sativa effects.</p>\n<p>The Sweet Special strain is part of Candy Kush&rsquo;s direct genetic background. Among other things, this strain is known for a sweet taste and hearty, durable plants. These assets translate to Candy Kush, as the plants are physically sturdy for growing indoors or out, and the taste is always pleasingly sweet. The legendary Royal Kush is the other genetic parent of Candy Kush. Royal Kush is a famously Indica-heavy strain, being descended itself from the inexpressibly potent Afghani Kush. Both Afghani and Royal Kush are prized amongst insomniacs for their sedative effects, and more casual and/or recreational smokers note the heavy &ldquo;couch-lock&rdquo; present in these strains.</p>\n<p>Since this strain does have slightly more Indica in its genetic background, a strong physical effect is present. However, the Sativa element of this strain shows itself in a heady, soaring euphoria. The Sativa aspects of Candy Kush help balance the effects, giving the soothing effects an unusual yet welcome energetic quality. This variety is gaining popularity for its unique blend of uplifting and deeply relaxing effects. The most effective medical uses of this strain are stress and pain relief. The low CBD content helps regulate the sedating effect, meaning that this strain has the capacity to relax without completely knocking users out.</p>\n<p>It is notable that even with low CBD, the THC content of this strain weighs in at a very hefty 18 percent, making it one of the more potent varieties available. If grown outdoors, these plants yield at least 450 dried grams or up to 500 grams per plant if grown outdoors, or 475 to 525 dried grams when grown indoors. Since this is a Fast Version flowering takes only seven weeks. When growing outdoors it is best to schedule for an early September harvest. When fully grown, the plants will reach a height of up to 100 cm indoors, or up to 170 cm outdoors.</p>\n<p>Like all Fast Versions, these Candy Kush plants make for an easy growing process. Even novice growers will find that it is surprisingly easy to quickly yield dense, high-quality buds through a straightforward growing process. Candy Kush Express FAST Version is ideal for growers who are interested in an unusually balanced strain that is easy to grow quickly in either indoor or outdoor conditions.</p>"

            "description": "<p>The result of this hybridisation is an enjoyable, low THC strain with good indoor and outdoor yields. Most strains with low THC contents have less of a psychoactive effect on users, making them better choices for people seeking medical treatment and pain relief without an accompanying high. Even without the strong psychoactive effects that other strains have, it is a pleasurable strain that medical users can savour. Two of its genetic components, Royal Medic and Royal Highness, get consistently high reviews for their pain-suppressing effects.</p>\n<p>Flavour wise, this strain has a deep, rich, almost honey like sweetness to it, accompanied by a bouquet of complex aromas. It isn't cloying or overpoweringly skunky, so even users who aren't deliberately seeking out a low THC strain for medicinal purposes will still get a lot of enjoyment out of these buds.</p>\n<p>Critical Mass is recommended for anyone from inexperienced to advanced growers, and this hybrid is pretty similar in that regard. This strain of medical marijuana is a good choice for most growers, no matter whether they are working with a tightly controlled indoor grow room or an outdoor growing set up. Its relatively short growth habit (from 0.6 metres up to about a metre in height) makes it a very manageable plant for indoor growers that don't have a lot of space to devote to a large grow room, and its indoor yield is well within the 500-550 grams per square metre range. Plants that are grown outdoors can reach from between a metre up to around a metre and a half, and yield about 500-550 grams per plant dried. No matter how it's grown, this plant offers a good yield in a small space.</p>\n<p>This strain has a fairly short flowering time of between 7 to 8 weeks, and can be harvested outdoors around the end of September. This short flowering time, short growth habit, and low THC levels make this strain just about ideal for medical cannabis users who are looking to grow their own medicine on a consistent basis. Growers who want to get the most out of this strain of cannabis' healing and pain relieving properties may want to harvest their plants a bit late in their flowering period, to maximise the buds' ratio of CBD to THC.</p>\n<p>Overall, Medical Mass is a very good new strain that comes from a really solid background. It smells good, it tastes good, it has a short flowering time, and it should be easy for most growers to handle in terms of both size and care. Users who want to avoid very psychoactive, high THC strains will love this one, and users who are looking to medicate should definitely give it a go.</p>"

This new strain combines two well-received parents, Juanita la Lagrimosa (Spanish for \"Juanita the Tearful\") and Royal Highness, which are themselves genetic hybrids of other precursor strains: Juanita the Tearful from Queen Mother and a Mexican-Afghan blend; Royal Highness from Dance Hall and Respect 13. On and on the strains date back in agricultural time, each new variety with its own unique smell, taste, color, high and medical benefit. However, in the past decade, a goal of all this tinkering has been what some producers are starting to call &ldquo;Royal Respect&rdquo; with the soul of marijuana's benefits going toward both body and mind.</p>\n<p>Painkiller XL is notable for its near-equal representation of 9 percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 9 percent cannabidiol (CBD), achieved by a seed that's 70 percent sativa and 30 percent indica.</p>\n<p>This new strain joins others rich in both CBD and THC like Euphoria, Royal Medic, Medical Mass and Danceworld that don't seek to downplay cannabis' psychoactive effects in favour of optimizing its healing role, but instead equalize the two. According to the California-based Steep Hill Cannabis Analysis Laboratory, this equalization brings to the cannabis user not just the physically healing aspects, but also the spiritually and psychologically healing benefits as well. There are other strains with very little THC and more CBD than Painkiller XL , but few are such splendid balances. Producers of this strain say it produces a considerable amount of pain relief, with a mild, relieving mental euphoria.</p>\n<p>With a flowering time of eight weeks, the Painkiller XL seed can produce 525 to 575 grams per plant indoors. Inside, the dried yield is 400 to 450 grams per plant. Inside, the plants average in height at about 31.5 inches (80 cm); outside, the average height is about 53 inches (135 cm), with harvest time at the end of September.</p>"

            "description": "<p>This strain stands out because of the high potency that it possesses as a result of being bred from the well-known OG Kush strain; although it isn't quite as strong as the original, this strain certainly offers quite a considerable mental effect.</p>\n<p>The indica heavy blend of this strain, and the high CBD:THC ratio that comes as a result of that, means that it is an excellent choice for customers who are looking for something to help with anxiety or other related problems, like migraines, PMS or general stress. The strain has also been praised for having a positive effect on people who have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or a reduced appetite. The effect that this plant offers is predominantly a head one but also offers some effect on the body - one of the primary appeals of this particular plant is its capacity as a relaxation aid for medical purposes. Combined with a tropical flavour these cannabis seeds will produce a plant that is a good fit for a range of purposes and customers.</p>\n<p>One of the most attractive aspects of the strain is it's sweet taste, which whilst being quite heavy on the pineapple (as you might imagine), it has been described as having some light mint or vanilla flavour. Some have detected notes of caramel amongst the tropical aroma - the fruity scent of this strain is rather strong. As mentioned earlier, as OG Kush is well known as one of the strongest strains of cannabis, this fruity twist on kush does retain some of that strength - although it's physical effect is far less pronounced than its parent plant. The mental effects are somewhat comparable, though, making it a very appealing prospect for someone who is looking for a cerebral experience without so much of a physical effect.</p>\n<p>A well-grown plant will reach a height of somewhere between 70 cm and 120 cm if grown inside, and between 120 cm and 180 cm if grown outside. Plants will typically produce a yield of about half a kilogram per square meter if you are growing indoors or per plant (once dried) if you are growing outdoors. These seeds have been feminized, meaning that your plants will all flower, which will happen after 7 - 8 weeks under normal circumstances. If you are planning to grow outside, the best time to harvest your plant would be the end of September.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a strain that offers great taste, a sweet smell and a very relaxing head effect, Pineapple Kush may be just the ticket. Certainly, fans of the strain would tell you that if you were ever to have the opportunity to try it, this is a strain not to be missed.</p>"

            "description": "<p>Sour Crack is a cross of 24 carat and an Auto Green Crack in development, then bred out to be fully autoflowering. Both photoperiod parents are extremely fast and frosty varieties. The Green Crack has the rush high, and the 24 Carat has the Afghan couchlock effect, together they make an incredibly powerful yet well rounded effect. Sour Crack is a Cracking variety (excuse the pun).</p>\n<p>After tests and breeding development, Mephisto Genetics found it to be THE FASTEST auto they have ever grown..(and believe us they have grown A LOT of autos over the years). Not only is it lightning fast but it is extremely resinous and potent to match. Mephisto Genetics were looking for a strain for stealthy quick runs, that could double as a commercial quality Autoflower Sea of green variety. With restrictive potting, the plants stay short, entering the flowering period early, and speed like a train until the finish.</p>\n<p>The flowers are rock hard, really easy to trim, great flower to leaf ratio, and showered with crystals. For an auto so fast you would expect there to be a compromise somewhere, but there really isn't. Sour Crack was tested by alpha-cat (www.alpha-cat.org) and the result was 19.5% thc.</p>"

            "description": "Hubbabubbasmelloscope is a very special part of Mephisto Genetics collection. Many years ago Bubblegum was the first Amsterdam cannabis we experienced, and so holds a sentimental reason to them. A couple of years ago they were lucky enough to be given a very special bubblegum cutting of 90â€™s serious seeds origin. Years later, several hundred plants were grown to find a matching high quality bubblegum smelling male to mate her with, but none matched her so she remains as an elite cutting..as a photoperiod. Mephisto Genetics crossed her to one of their high quality auto parents that is a good balance between indica and sativa. The results of this pairing have really made them happy! The bubblegum smell and taste is dominant amongst a high proportion. There are Indica and Sativa phenotypes but the inbetween phenotypes are their favourite. She likes to get big! Plants love to branch into the typical Christmas tree pattern, and she can exceed 100 cm tall and wide to match in the right conditions. The buds are generally compact, and there are A LOT of them. So yields are splendid. She doesn't waste trichomes on fan leaves, however the buds late in flower are totally encrusted in resin. She can also purple up when shown cold temperatures. \nMephisto Genetics have recorded a good resistance to mould. Great candidate for training if your space is limited. She oozes taste, smell and an amazing sweet flavour, she has a euphoric giggly and creative effect, sheâ€™s their go to girl for a social party. Mephisto Genetics are yet to have her analysed for thc content, but they have high hopes.\n\nIn a good environment, 60+g is easily achievable."

She is a heavy hitter, that produces EXTREMELY dense buds, fan leaves can grow to the size of dinner plates, smaller fan leaves and stems that are coated with thick resin.\n\nShe exhibits pink and purple phenotypes so is beautiful as well as potent. She grows 50-70cm tall as a little bush if given the space (you can also pack these tightly together for an amazingly productive sea-of green) She is stout with a thick stem, branches and tight internodes, because of this she has a very high bud to plant ratio. She is a real stinker, so be careful and always use a Carbon Filter. She is also Mephisto Genetics most medicinal strain, helpful for sleep and aches and pains, and appetite stimulation.\n\n24 carat was tested by alpha-cat (www.alpha-cat.org) and the result was 15% thc.\n\nExpect at least 50g of dense frosty goodness when treated well."

They took a 24 carat female (Sour boggle cut x purple indica auto) and hit her with some Hubbabubbasmelloscope male pollen (Bubblegum cut x w.w auto). The result is a hybrid with fantastic vigour from the hubbabubbasmelloscope, even in restrictive pots she can reach 120cm. But the buds are 24 carat dominant, Sour, hard and dripping with resin. She is an amazing hashplant! Stems, fan leaves, everywhere, completely covered with trichomes! Late in flower her buds look grey with crystals. The smell is sour, strong but with a hint of the bubblegum sweetness in there.\nThe buds are fat, and she has the potential to really yield! If you spot a plant that is kicking into flower a little later than the other girls, train her if you havenâ€™t got space, as she has an extra weeks veg time you can make the most of it and get an even higher yield. When she kicks into flower she really goes for it. Sour bubbly is the best of both, she gets big but finishes quickly, and the buds are of impeccable quality. You really canâ€™t go wrong with this lady. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nSour Bubbly was tested by alpha-cat (www.alpha-cat.org) and the result was 19.5% thc.\n\nTreat her kindly and you can achieve up to 90g."

In addition, it is larger than other automatics and flowers in only 60 days.  It produces the most abundant sweet-smelling resin, dense plants with thick Indica leaves, and buds as sticky as honey.  The smell that this plant emits makes it irresistible. It is a variety that stands cold weather fairly well."

The plant has an excellent calyx-to-leaf ratio and from the first few weeks of flowering becomes covered with a thick and abundant coat of resin.\n\nThe smell given off by the stems when rubbed is particularly striking. Outdoors the plant will reach 2 m high, although this is made up with its lateral growth. By topping you can achieve a large number of strong branches and hundreds of cuttings.

Although the lemon-green colour of the leaves may mislead you into thinking that it needs more, this is not usually the case. Try to keep the EC levels during flowering between 1.8 and 2.2, so as not to over-fertilize the plant and saturate the roots. Diesel Glue will be ready in 8 weeks, although certain seeds may need another week to reinforce the flavour and ripen properly. Outdoors harvest is during the second week of October."
