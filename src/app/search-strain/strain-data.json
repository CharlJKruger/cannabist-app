She can be grown outdoors but will require hot weather like Australia, North Africa and California, however may need to be grown in a greenhouse due to her long flower period.</p>\n<p>Amnesia haze is one of our best yielding cannabis strains, producing 70-80 g per plant with up to 650+- g per metre squared under a 600w light. She can produce big outside, with full sun, reaching as much as 700g per plant. However extra care should be taken outdoors as this is a sensitive plant, so problems with weather, bugs or irrigation will harm your final harvest.</p>\n<p>The only down side with Amnesia haze is the long flower time required of 12 weeks. Although this is high enough to make most commercial growers run for the hills, true cannabis connoisseurs will find the wait more than worth it. Amnesia Haze is suitable for both hydro and soil grows, sea/screen of green too.</p>\n<p>Every hit comes with a truly psychedelic head high, likely to send any user straight into the astrosphere. The flavour is fresh and fruity like you expect from a haze which only makes the smoke so much more enjoyable. Smokers are warned this is a strong smoke and, as the name suggests, users can often turn their brains off completely after a session.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Coming out of the California/Oregon melting pot of genetics we found a wonderful marijuana strain which we developed into a feminized seed to bring Blue Mystic. This Indica dominant plant is short-stacked, with little stretching, growing almost like bonsai or broccoli. It can grow just over 1 m tall but we advise growers to either pinch or top the plant to produce more of a bushy plant.</p>\n<p>Since it will not grow much vertically, bushing the volume of the plant sideways can give better results for yield. We also recommend a week longer than normal in veg with Blue Mystic, again to maximise the yield. Normally, it will do 55-65 g per plant indoors. On average, thatâ€™s about 400-500 g per square metre under a 600w light. Outdoors, it needs the warmth of the Mediterranean or California and does not do well in northern Europe.</p>\n<p>Blue Mystic Feminized can be ready for harvest after 8 weeks, giving it a vibrant sweet taste of fresh fruit. If given a little longer (up to 10 weeks), it will lose some flavour but pay you back with a heavier body stoned effect. As always, we recommend drying your plants before manicuring the buds, but itâ€™s especially recommended with Blue Mystic to bring about the full flavour of this plant.</p>\n<p>If captured correctly, the flavour of Blue Mystic should be so sweet and refreshing as to give the smoker an actual taste of drinking juice. This intense flavour is equally matched with a super potent Indica stone that leaves users physically locked-down.</p>"

It will produce relatively wider internode spacing, with long thin leafs, demonstrating its sativa background. Upon flowering is when its Afghan heritage comes to life, with dense, resin-covered nuggets which form all over the plant; however, it will produce a giant main cola.</p>\n<p>It will yield on average 50-60 g per plant, or about 500 g per square metre under a 600w light. Grown outdoors, it can give as much as 625 g per plant, but will need the nice warm environment of southern Spain, California or North Africa. Placed in full sunlight and given enough food and water, Northern Lights will grow into a tree and give excellent results for yield.</p>\n<p>Flowering is complete after 7-8 weeks, although some growers report harvesting after just 7 weeks. During the flowering process, all buds are formed with a light, resin-covered surface which starts to glow towards the end of the grow.</p>\n\nNorthern Lights is simply one of those knockout smokes that guarantees a couchlock session for the next few minutes. The Afghan heritage really shines through in the smoke, and anyone looking for that strong stone need seek no further than Northern Lights Feminized."

Grown outdoors, it prefers a warmer climate such as in Spain, Italy or California and, given the right conditions, will produce up to 675 grams per plant. Due to its relatively short flowering time, it can be grown in more northern latitudes (UK, Netherlands); however, it will not reach its full potential as she would indoors.</p>\n<p>No other plant from Royal Queen Seeds will yield as much in 7 weeks as Critical Feminized. This short flowering time makes it suitable for growers with a tight schedule. Commercial growers will be pleased with the results in sea/screen of green operations as it delivers large yields with very little maintenance.</p>\n<p>The final key to a good commercial crop is a solid smoke; it wouldn't make sense to have such a high-yielding plant with no power in the puff. Therefore we are glad to say that Critical offers just as much in the stone as it does in the yield. It brings a nice stoned effect which mellows you down into a relaxed vibration.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Kush is to Indica varieties what Haze means to Sativa. Much like skunk, kush is a term which can be used to describe a whole lineage of cannabis plants. We use the term Indica today to describe a type of plant which is found naturally (indigenous to) in the India Region. At that time all plants were called Cannabis Sativa, but there was something very different about these varieties which required discrimination into another category, named Indica due to the region where they were first discovered.</p>\n<p>We decided to resurrect one of these old school Kush strains by bringing it into the modern era with a feminized only seed. Special Kush is our lowest-price seed, perfect for the budget grower. If youâ€™re looking for some decent smoke without the heavy price tag, Special Kush is perfect for you.</p>\n<p>Special Kush likes to grow wild as if in the mountains of Afghanistan; this means it will fill up any space it can. Indoors, care should be taken that it doesnâ€™t overgrow its space, but given enough space, like outdoors, it can grow to over 3 m tall. It will be finished flowering in 7-8 weeks and can yield about 65-150 g per plant indoors, 475 g per square metre under a 600w light. Grown outdoors, it needs that warm environment such as can be found in Italy or North Africa. With enough sun, food and water, this tree can yield over 550 g per plant.</p>\n<p>Generally, the buds from Special Kush are small and tight nuggets of frosty goodness which are spread all over the plant. The smoke carries a very hash-like taste with a full body stone present from its Indica background. This is a simple and basic plant, with good smoke, available in a feminized seed for a low price.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Cheese is a legendary cannabis plant with origins based in the UK. This marijuana strain has its heritage from some original Skunk #1 that was rediscovered then developed by a dedicated crew of cannabis growers from London. Finally they gave birth to a skunk that was so stinky that there seemed no more fitting a name than Cheese.</p>\n<p>Royal Cheese Feminized will grow to about 1 metre indoors, but will stretch to 2.0 metres out in the sun. This marijuana strain loves to drink and will grow big and strong as a result. The biggest issue encountered when growing Royal Cheese Feminized is the smell. This cannabis plant stinks so much that a carbon filter is almost essential for indoors, while everyone in the immediate radius will smell it outside.</p>\n<p>Grown indoors, Royal Cheese will yield on average 60 grams per plant or 450-550 grams per square metre. Outdoors, this plant will tower above everything else and can yield over 600 grams in the correct climate (Spain, Italy, and California). It can be grown outdoors in northern Europe too, but will produce a lower quality buds than if grown indoors.</p>\n<p>Royal Cheese from Royal Queen Seeds can be harvested 8 weeks after flowering to achieve the strongest flavour. Leaving it 2 weeks longer, 10 weeks, will give less flavour but will pack more of a punch. Different growers enjoy different effects so it's up to you personally to experiment which is the right time for you; however, as a general rule, Cheese can be harvested at 8 weeks.</p>\n<p>The effect from Cheese is quite simply fantastic; carrying such a strong, pungent aroma which follows through with a good flavour.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Our Royal Moby is a Dutch twist on a Spanish classic, brought to you in a feminized seed. Being a sativa dominant plant, it will grow big and strong throughout the flowering period. Indoors it can reach 2 metres, outdoors in the sun it will grow to over 3 metres tall. It grows exactly as you would expect a sativa to, with long stretchy branches, and lots of buds all over.</p>\n<p>The size of Royal Moby during its growth is rewarded with the yield that can be harvested. Indoor growers can expect 75 g per plant or 600 g per square metre under a 600w light. Grown outdoors it needs lots of sun, like along the Mediterranean; however, it can also be grown in extremely hot, tropical environments. In these conditions, these 3 m tall plants can grow up to 1000 g per plant. In both cases, indoors/outdoors, Royal Moby likes to grow big and will need lots of good nourishment to help it.</p>\n<p>The only Indica trait to carry through in this hybrid is a short flowering period of 9-10 weeks. For commercial growers who can afford a little more time and room, Royal Moby is the perfect option for those willing to make a sacrifice for a better smoke. The high that comes from smoking this is beyond astronomical, a pure psychedelic experience. Royal Moby is amongst the strongest THC-bearing cannabis plants we sell, and it's truly felt with every smoke of a joint or bong.</p>"

Our Royal Critical Automatic was bred to be just like Critical, the auto-flowering genetics just make it easier to grow.

Royal Critical Automatic will be ready to harvest just 9 weeks after planting.</p>\n<p>It is an easy-to-grow auto-flowering variety, a complex cross of Ruderalis, Indica and Sativa strains. This mix has produced a strong plant with the characteristic big, dense buds and heavy indica effect of the Critical. Royal Critical Automatic will grow to around 60 to 80 cm in height. Although small and bushy, it has an open structure which allows light to get to the whole plant, meaning even bigger and better harvests. It will give good yields of around 165 g per plant of large, dense buds with a sweet skunk aroma.</p>"

Generally, it will not grow any taller than 50 to 60 cm. If grown well, it can yield up to 150 g per plant, and some growers have achieved even more. The plants have a fresh, herbal, almost citrus-like aroma. The taste is mild but good, and comes with a pleasant physically stoned effect.</p>"

Others say that itâ€™s just a special cutting of ChemDawg from the early 90s. Even the meaning of the name OG has been debated; with some saying it means Original Gangster. However, now, because of its origins, most people agree it means Ocean Grown.</p>\n<p>One thing that is not debated is the popularity of this feminized cannabis strain. From Hollywood movie stars and rappers to medical marijuana users, OG Kush is loved by many. The most obvious trait of OG Kush is its strong, unique, very dank, slightly citrus aroma, almost like fuel or strong detergent. The flavour of OG Kush is equally as strong and dank, with a long-lasting aftertaste.</p>\n<p>OG Kush is an extremely strong cannabis strain, with most experienced smokers listing it as one of their favourites. The effect is as strong physically as it is mentally. Though its effect is like an Sativa, the strain's genetics are mostly Indica. The effect is as strong and complex as the flavour. OG Kush takes around 8 weeks to flower and on average the yield is 65 grams per plant.</p>\n<p>OG Kush is known to stretch slightly during growth but soon starts to fill out during flowering. Generally, it will reach a height of 90 to 160 cm. Its buds are large and dense, lime green clusters covered with a large amount of resin. There are many good reasons why OG Kush has become so popular. Now available as a feminized variety from Royal Queen Seeds, so you can try out this amazing strain yourself.</p>"

She is said to be easy to cultivate and doesn't require any special marijuana farming skills. Her cannabis seeds are suitable for indoor and outdoor growing.&nbsp; Strong Central American genes make Tikal seeds cope very well with mild stress situations. An incredible trichomes production, a flower density and a devastating power, which knocks down the hardest and most nervous smokers, turns this marijuana strain into a cannabinoids bomb full of sweet flowers of strawberry aroma.<br />Tikal marijuana variety has a strong sativa structure, her tall thin plants with well developed branches shoot straight up like candles. Leaf to bud ratio is pretty good, though some pruning might be required. Her flowering period is within the minimum lever set for sativas; it takes this cannabis just 10 weeks to start producing medium sized nodes full of generous trichomes; THC content is said to be as high as 18-20%.<br />Medicine produced from Tikal sativa plants have lower CBD and higher THC counts which produce a very powerful, long-lasting and therapeutic effect. Strong, dense and psychedelic high in the beginning, followed by a relaxing stage that leads to a physical and mental hibernation</p>"

    "description": "<p>ACE Seeds Orient Express&nbsp; is a potent F1 marijuana hybrid from Ace Seeds industry whose breeders combined the high production of aromatic and resinous flowers of a Vietnam Black mother with the low height and short flowering time of a Yunnan Chinese indica. This cannabis strain is sativa dominated and shows characteristics typical for sativas, except, maybe, the height. Ace seed selectors did their best and created a petite Asian lady perfect for indoor and outdoor cultivation. Her size doesn't exceed 130 cm, the plants developed from Orient Express seeds, are column like with more buds sites than on an indica. The buds are somehow less dense, however, the final product is of an incredible quality. THC content is said to be between 14 and 16%, giving a cerebral sativa effect, less strong on the body and with a more pronounced effect on the brain, where it goes from a creative feeling to a trippy one according to the power.<br /><br />Orient Express has a compact structure with good branching. After a short flowering, which lasts only 9 weeks, she goes into a quick bud maturing phase. A deep and organic marijuana aroma appears from the beginning of her flowering. Smoking is muddy flavoured with floral details.<br />All cannabis seeds selected and bred by Ace Seeds industry are specially designed for indoor and outdoor cultivation. They are very resistant to diseases and cope well with any climate surprises, warm or cold. This cannabis variety can bring a variety to your marijuana gardens and is highly recommended to anyone who likes Asian flavours</p>"

Dance World will have a yield of around 400 to 450 grams per plant.</p>\n<p>The smell is not too strong during growth or flowering.

There may be some blue or purple hues to the leaves and buds, depending on the environmental conditions.</p>\n<p>Its genetics are believed to be an original Blueberry plant from DJ Shorts crossed with a Super Silver Haze plant originating in The Netherlands. This great hybrid brings together the sweetness and heavy-yielding traits of the Blueberry, invigorated by the uplifting Haze high. The effect is mainly Sativa, a smooth, uplifting high that turns in a more relaxing Indica. Its flavour mainly comes from the Blueberry though there are subtle tastes of Haze in her buds.

It is a heavy feeder so it can happily absorb strong bloom boosters and nutrients.</p>\n\n<p>Though it can be a bit more difficult to grow, the plant tends to like lower humidity levels, as it can be at risk of bud rot, mould or powdery mildew. This, however, is mainly due to its heavy, dense buds â€“ so as long as you take care with the plant, it is more than worth the extra attention. It responds well to cropping and trimming and we advise you not to let it grow too tall during vegetative growth as the plant tends to stretch during the first few weeks of flowering. Flowering takes around 8 to 10 weeks, with around 9 being the average.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Honey Cream is fast becoming a classic strain in Spain, where it was first grown. Its genetics are a mix of heavy Indicas with worldwide influence. A three-way cross between BlueBlack, Maple Leaf Indica and White Rhino, this is one beautiful, complex and strong plant that shows clear signs of hybrid vigour.</p>\n<p>After flowering starts, Honey Cream Fast Version (formerly Royal Caramel) will be ready to harvest in 7 to 8 weeks, but don&rsquo;t rush &ndash; let it mature fully and you will be rewarded with a potent harvest. Indoors, it will normally yield around 500 grams per square metre. Experienced growers may even achieve up to 650 grams per metre. Outdoors, it will be ready in September and will yield around the same per plant, depending on the climate and conditions.</p>\n<p>Honey Cream has an intense, sweet sugary, almost caramel-like aroma. The flavour, while not as sweet as the aroma, is sweet and almost earthy. Due to its complex genetics, a variety of tastes and smells can come from these plants, but the sweet, creamy caramel aroma overpowers all.</p>\n<p>It grows like a classic Indica &ndash; short and bushy, with a huge flowering top of dense, resinous buds. The effect, as you would expect from such an Indica, is a heavy and relaxing. Perfect for relaxation, some medicinal users have found benefits for various physical ailments. All of this makes Honey Cream a great strain for Indica lovers.</p>\n<p>Now with a Faster Flowering time than before!</p>"

    "description": "Royal Queen Seeds are proud to add this fine cannabis strain to their selection. This might be one of the most famous strains of cannabis on the planet; and maybe one of the strongest.\n \nLike many of the best cannabis strains coming out these days, Sour Diesel comes straight from California. It is one of the  favourite strains amongst many. These powerful American genetics will grow well indoors around the world; outdoors, on the other hand, they need a warm climate, similar to California or Spain.\n \nThis is a mostly Sativa strain which shows in both its growth structure and the strong effect. The plant develops its resinous buds and powerful aroma over a 10-week flowering period. This is after a recommended 3-to-4 week vegetative period. These plants will grow to a height of around 100-160 cm. indoors, with some stretching during early flowering.\n \nSour Diesel is a very pungent, aromatic strain. Heavy chemical, herbal and sour flavours come from its glistening buds. When grown well, it will give yields of 450-600 grams per square metre. This is both a yield in quantity and quality, producing high-quality, resinous, aromatic buds. Full Diesel power!"

    "description": "<p>The Amnesia Haze Automatic is the result of many years of breeding. A cross of Amnesia Haze, bred in The Netherlands in the 1990's by Hy-Pro Seeds. The original Amnesia, aka Amnesia Haze, Champagne Haze, The Bomb, Ultra Haze and many others names, is a classic Sativa strain that's popular worldwide.</p> \n<p>The biggest downside of Sativa strains like Amnesia is that it can take a while to flower, 12 weeks on average, but some pheno-types can take up 20 weeks. She can also grow quite tall; this can be another issue for some with limited space. The Amnesia Haze Automatic aims to solve these problems. Offering the same euphoric high and spicy, sweet taste as the original Amnesia but with a heavily reduced growth time and a much smaller height.</p> \n<p>Indoors, she will take around 80 days from seed to bud. In this time she can grow quite large, especially when compared to other auto-flowering strains. This is a clear sign of her Sativa dominant genetics - tall plants, large thin leaves and long stretching buds. The Amnesia Haze Automatic is a vigorous plant that can grow to heights of around 80-150 cm. This large Sativa dominant auto-flowering strains, much like the original Amnesia, gives generous yields of high quality hazey buds. She likes to be fed well, but be careful not to over feed her, as like as Hazes she can be sensitive to nutrients.</p> \n<p>After 80 days of growth and flowering you will be left with a good yield, around 40 grams on average and up to 150 grams in ideal conditions. She gives long, fox tail like buds with a sweet, spicy, musky aroma. All in all she has the classic Amnesia aroma, flavour and effect. The Amnesia Haze Automatic is the perfect auto-flowering variety for lovers of the Haze.</p>"

Its flavour is mainly the chemical, fuel-like diesel taste but not quite as overpowering. There is also a slight citrus aroma in the buds.

The Jack Herer strain is equally powerful, a strong Sativa dominant with an uplifting high and a fresh peppery aroma.\n \nJack Herer Automatic grows buds that are very similar to the original Jack Herer. However, as this strain is autoflowering, it can be grown almost anywhere. The plants will grow quickly and be ready to harvest in around 10 weeks.\n \nThe main effect is an uplifting and creative Sativa high, but thanks to Jack Herer's mix of Haze, Northern Lights and Skunk, this strain also gives you a relaxing Indica feeling. Jack Herer Automatic has a Haze-like, peppery aroma.\n \nJack Herer Automatic will perform well in both indoor and outdoor grows, giving an average yield of around 40 to 70 grams per plant. It will not grow too tall, reaching an average height of 40 to 90 cm, which makes it ideal for smaller space. Royal Queen Seeds is proud to carry on the tribute to Jack Herer, the Emperor of Hemp, with this great autoflowering strain."

It offers a good balance of Indica, Sativa and autoflowering Ruderalis genetics, though the Indica is definitely the dominant effect.\n \nOn average, Sweet Skunk Automatic will produce around 40-50 grams per plant, sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the environment.

Indoors it will grow to an average height of around 50 cm, with some larger plants reaching 100 cm.

These two genetic traits, landrace sativa, and heavy-resin indica were chosen primarily for their abilities to get a user \"high\".\n\nFor this reason, White Widow is without a doubt one of the most successful commercialized cannabis strains on the market.\n\nBuy White Widow seeds from Seedsman today and experience the very best in strain potency and cultivation efficiency."

Having been successfully stabilized, Skunk No. 1 has been widely used as a breeding parent for most of today&rsquo;s leading \"skunk\" and many other strains. It is very easy to grow and has always been seen as a standard against which others can be measured.  It produces dense buds varying in colour from light green to golden with a very high yield. It is easy to manicure due to its high bud-to-leaf ratio. It has a sweet smell and taste with a cerebral high.</p>"

Over all she is quite an easy plant to maintain, with little stretching during flower for a Sativa, combined with her big bud structure altogether making her a pleasant plant to grow.  This relatively easy maintenance makes her suitable for both soil and hydro set ups, especially for Sea/Screen of Green operations. \n\nGrown indoors on average you get a yield of 65-75 g per plant or between 500 per m2. Grown outdoors, she prefers a warmer climate such as in Spain, Italy or California and given the right conditions will produce over 100g per plant. Due to her relatively short flower time she can be grown in more northern latitudes (UK, Netherlands), however, will not reach her full potential as she would indoors.  \n\nFlowering will be finished after 7-8 weeks to maximise flavour, but she can go a week longer to give an extra kick. Overall her short flower time, easy grow and big yield makes her a contender for the selection of those commercial â€˜cash-cropsâ€™.\n\nSweet, fruit like aroma."

L.S.D. is a hardy, disease resistant plant that responds well in all grow conditions. The flavor is intense earthy chestnut with a sweet musky smell. The LSD produces a euphoric, almost psychedelic experience. It&rsquo;s a super-trippy and very powerful stone, a Barney&rsquo;s Farm special.</p>"

    "description": "<p>It took our finest Blueberry strains to equal the awesome flavour of the Cheese, and the two together have created an ultimate hybrid. After the original crossing she was back-crossed with the Cheese to stabilise the genetics and perfect the taste and effect of this strain.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Cheese typically takes around 60 to 65 days to complete her flowering period. The sweet, fruity Cheese aroma starts to develop just a few weeks after the start of flowering and continues to develop and intensify as the plant matures. Most plants will reach a height of around 80 to 140 cm. When grown outdoors she can grow a little taller and will be ready for harvest at the end of September.</p>\n\n<p>Good growers will find they get equally good yields - you can expect an easy average of 500 to 550 grams per square metre. The only down side of Blue Cheese is the slightly above average leaf-to-flower ratio, meaning she will be a little harder to trim. However this little bit of extra work more than pays off on the end product. Blue Cheese performs extremely well in sea of green techniques as well as with both hydroponic and soil based methods of growing.</p>\n\n<p>The flavour of this strain is the perfect blend of its parentâ€™s genetics. The sweet, fruity flavour of the Blueberry perfectly compliments the earthy, musky flavour of the Cheese. The buds are extremely dense and, when grown properly, are covered with a thick layer of trichomes. If youâ€™re a fan of Cheese then you might want to try our Blue Cheese.</p>"

    "description": "<p>This variety was bred to incorporate the best elements of all strains to create a plant that is both easy to cultivate and presents a fantastic product. This strain has a pleasantly sweet taste with subtly earthy undertones and a strong, stony, positive effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Bubble Gum</strong><br />From its origins in Indiana to its later development in the Netherlands, this world-famous indica strain has developed notoriety for its easy-going yet soaring effect. The distinctive sweet taste and smell of this award-winning cannabis contributes to the similarly idiosyncratic yet pleasing sweet flavour of Bubble Kush Automatic.</p>\n<p><strong>OG Kush</strong><br />This exceedingly popular strain has qualities of both indica and sativa, and its intense and long-lasting effects have played no small part in the variety's fame throughout the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Royal Critical Automatic</strong><br />Royal Critical Automatic is popular with growers due its exceptionally quick and easy growing process and large per-plant yields. <br /><br />As far as growing is concerned, these seeds are autoflowering. Unlike traditional feminized seeds, such as traditional Bubba Kush and Bubble Kush Feminized seeds, growers do not have to worry about making sure the plants get 12 hours of direct light a day. Thanks to the ruderalis elements of this strain's genetics, these plants flower on their own within about five to seven weeks, just like other seeds such as Bubble Gum Automatic or Bubba Kush Automatic, both of which are similarly beloved by growers for yield and ease of growing.</p>\n<p>When growing outdoors, Bubble Kush Automatic is ready for harvest in seven to eight weeks. Indoors, fully grown plants are 70 to 100 centimetres high, and outdoors the height ranges from 100 to 140 centimeters. Growers can expect a healthy yield of 120 to 170 grams per outdoor plant after drying.</p>\n<p>Once harvested, this variety packs a wallop with 16 percent THC. The dominant effect reported with this strain is a sense of euphoria, with many users noting this variety's usefulness for stress release. Since this cannabis is genetically 60 percent indica, typical incida effects are also present including increased appetite and physical relaxation. Some insomniacs find this strain useful as a sleep aid, but the well-rounded high does not leave users feeling overwhelmingly lethargic or drowsy.</p>\n<p>These hardy seeds are ideal for growers who desire a fast growing and automatically flowering plant that does not require the same effort as more traditional feminized seeds. This hybrid strain is continuing to earn fans not only for its straightforward growing process but also its agreeable taste and robust effects.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Euphoria CBD is a superior blend of selective heredity between the popular cannabis strains of Royal Medic and Shark Shock. Royal Medic is a strain of cannabis that owes the majority of its genetics to the Juanita la Lagrimosa and is recognized as one of the high CBD strains and those genetics have been passed on to Euphoria. Shark Shock is a strain that has been a flourishing champion of the High Times Cannabis Cup since the late 1990s and it is a tremendously hardy grower. You will find those qualities are ever present in the Euphoria strain.</p>\n<p>CBD is an abbreviation for cannabidiol, which is often great for combating medical conditions such as Crohn's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis. Those who suffer from medical conditions that induce pain and discomfort, often turn to strains of cannabis that are known to be higher in CBD. Euphoria inherited this high CBD and contains more CBD than it does THC but, the percentages are pretty close at 7% and 6% respectively.</p>\n<p>Euphoria CBD's genetic background thoroughly infuses this strain of Euphoria with a sweet and particularly fruity scent that continues on into the taste for quite a pleasant aroma. Being that it is 20 percent Sativa and 80 percent Indica, there is more of a euphoric mood that does not encourage sleepiness but is great for pain and nervous tension relief. This makes for great medical remedy. It is a short to average size plant reaching heights outdoors of 100 to 140 cm. With indoor heights established at 60 to 100 cm, due to the high percentage of Indica which are in general, shorter and stockier plants.</p>\n<p>The yield produced by this plant is quite nice from the Indica structure. You will time and again find indoor and outdoor yields of 400 to as much as 450 grams per dried plant with no more than an 8 week flowering period! Not bad for medical marijuana, especially when you might find competitor strains taking as long as 10 weeks to flower!</p>\n<p>Euphoria is certainly one of the CBD strains. These are known to produce anti-anxiety and even anti-inflammatory reactions to those who use it. This is without having to endure a heavy couched or locked down feeling that is associated with some competitor strains. Anytime levels of CBD are found to be over 4%, this is considered to be a high amount. Euphoria, contains 7% CBD.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Generally, even strains that combine a Sativa and an Indica background tend to lean heavily towards one side or the other in both genetic background and effect. However, Candy Kush Express FAST Version is unique even amongst Indica/Sativa hybrids: at 40 percent sativa and 60 percent Indica, this Kush strain is about as close to a true, evenly mixed hybrid that there is available. This translates to a unique blend of both Indica and Sativa effects.</p>\n<p>The Sweet Special strain is part of Candy Kush&rsquo;s direct genetic background. Among other things, this strain is known for a sweet taste and hearty, durable plants. These assets translate to Candy Kush, as the plants are physically sturdy for growing indoors or out, and the taste is always pleasingly sweet. The legendary Royal Kush is the other genetic parent of Candy Kush. Royal Kush is a famously Indica-heavy strain, being descended itself from the inexpressibly potent Afghani Kush. Both Afghani and Royal Kush are prized amongst insomniacs for their sedative effects, and more casual and/or recreational smokers note the heavy &ldquo;couch-lock&rdquo; present in these strains.</p>\n<p>Since this strain does have slightly more Indica in its genetic background, a strong physical effect is present. However, the Sativa element of this strain shows itself in a heady, soaring euphoria. The Sativa aspects of Candy Kush help balance the effects, giving the soothing effects an unusual yet welcome energetic quality. This variety is gaining popularity for its unique blend of uplifting and deeply relaxing effects. The most effective medical uses of this strain are stress and pain relief. The low CBD content helps regulate the sedating effect, meaning that this strain has the capacity to relax without completely knocking users out.</p>\n<p>It is notable that even with low CBD, the THC content of this strain weighs in at a very hefty 18 percent, making it one of the more potent varieties available. If grown outdoors, these plants yield at least 450 dried grams or up to 500 grams per plant if grown outdoors, or 475 to 525 dried grams when grown indoors. Since this is a Fast Version flowering takes only seven weeks. When growing outdoors it is best to schedule for an early September harvest. When fully grown, the plants will reach a height of up to 100 cm indoors, or up to 170 cm outdoors.</p>\n<p>Like all Fast Versions, these Candy Kush plants make for an easy growing process. Even novice growers will find that it is surprisingly easy to quickly yield dense, high-quality buds through a straightforward growing process. Candy Kush Express FAST Version is ideal for growers who are interested in an unusually balanced strain that is easy to grow quickly in either indoor or outdoor conditions.</p>"

    "description": "<p>The result of this hybridisation is an enjoyable, low THC strain with good indoor and outdoor yields. Most strains with low THC contents have less of a psychoactive effect on users, making them better choices for people seeking medical treatment and pain relief without an accompanying high. Even without the strong psychoactive effects that other strains have, it is a pleasurable strain that medical users can savour. Two of its genetic components, Royal Medic and Royal Highness, get consistently high reviews for their pain-suppressing effects.</p>\n<p>Flavour wise, this strain has a deep, rich, almost honey like sweetness to it, accompanied by a bouquet of complex aromas. It isn't cloying or overpoweringly skunky, so even users who aren't deliberately seeking out a low THC strain for medicinal purposes will still get a lot of enjoyment out of these buds.</p>\n<p>Critical Mass is recommended for anyone from inexperienced to advanced growers, and this hybrid is pretty similar in that regard. This strain of medical marijuana is a good choice for most growers, no matter whether they are working with a tightly controlled indoor grow room or an outdoor growing set up. Its relatively short growth habit (from 0.6 metres up to about a metre in height) makes it a very manageable plant for indoor growers that don't have a lot of space to devote to a large grow room, and its indoor yield is well within the 500-550 grams per square metre range. Plants that are grown outdoors can reach from between a metre up to around a metre and a half, and yield about 500-550 grams per plant dried. No matter how it's grown, this plant offers a good yield in a small space.</p>\n<p>This strain has a fairly short flowering time of between 7 to 8 weeks, and can be harvested outdoors around the end of September. This short flowering time, short growth habit, and low THC levels make this strain just about ideal for medical cannabis users who are looking to grow their own medicine on a consistent basis. Growers who want to get the most out of this strain of cannabis' healing and pain relieving properties may want to harvest their plants a bit late in their flowering period, to maximise the buds' ratio of CBD to THC.</p>\n<p>Overall, Medical Mass is a very good new strain that comes from a really solid background. It smells good, it tastes good, it has a short flowering time, and it should be easy for most growers to handle in terms of both size and care. Users who want to avoid very psychoactive, high THC strains will love this one, and users who are looking to medicate should definitely give it a go.</p>"

On and on the strains date back in agricultural time, each new variety with its own unique smell, taste, color, high and medical benefit. However, in the past decade, a goal of all this tinkering has been what some producers are starting to call &ldquo;Royal Respect&rdquo; with the soul of marijuana's benefits going toward both body and mind.</p>\n<p>Painkiller XL is notable for its near-equal representation of 9 percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 9 percent cannabidiol (CBD), achieved by a seed that's 70 percent sativa and 30 percent indica.</p>\n<p>This new strain joins others rich in both CBD and THC like Euphoria, Royal Medic, Medical Mass and Danceworld that don't seek to downplay cannabis' psychoactive effects in favour of optimizing its healing role, but instead equalize the two. According to the California-based Steep Hill Cannabis Analysis Laboratory, this equalization brings to the cannabis user not just the physically healing aspects, but also the spiritually and psychologically healing benefits as well. There are other strains with very little THC and more CBD than Painkiller XL , but few are such splendid balances. Producers of this strain say it produces a considerable amount of pain relief, with a mild, relieving mental euphoria.</p>\n<p>With a flowering time of eight weeks, the Painkiller XL seed can produce 525 to 575 grams per plant indoors. Inside, the dried yield is 400 to 450 grams per plant. Inside, the plants average in height at about 31.5 inches (80 cm); outside, the average height is about 53 inches (135 cm), with harvest time at the end of September.</p>"

The strain has also been praised for having a positive effect on people who have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or a reduced appetite. The effect that this plant offers is predominantly a head one but also offers some effect on the body - one of the primary appeals of this particular plant is its capacity as a relaxation aid for medical purposes. Combined with a tropical flavour these cannabis seeds will produce a plant that is a good fit for a range of purposes and customers.</p>\n<p>One of the most attractive aspects of the strain is it's sweet taste, which whilst being quite heavy on the pineapple (as you might imagine), it has been described as having some light mint or vanilla flavour. Some have detected notes of caramel amongst the tropical aroma - the fruity scent of this strain is rather strong. As mentioned earlier, as OG Kush is well known as one of the strongest strains of cannabis, this fruity twist on kush does retain some of that strength - although it's physical effect is far less pronounced than its parent plant. The mental effects are somewhat comparable, though, making it a very appealing prospect for someone who is looking for a cerebral experience without so much of a physical effect.</p>\n<p>A well-grown plant will reach a height of somewhere between 70 cm and 120 cm if grown inside, and between 120 cm and 180 cm if grown outside. Plants will typically produce a yield of about half a kilogram per square meter if you are growing indoors or per plant (once dried) if you are growing outdoors. These seeds have been feminized, meaning that your plants will all flower, which will happen after 7 - 8 weeks under normal circumstances. If you are planning to grow outside, the best time to harvest your plant would be the end of September.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a strain that offers great taste, a sweet smell and a very relaxing head effect, Pineapple Kush may be just the ticket. Certainly, fans of the strain would tell you that if you were ever to have the opportunity to try it, this is a strain not to be missed.</p>"

The aroma is a mixture of berry fruit, diesel drain, and diesel petroleum. It is recognized to be remarkably constant, churning out dependable outcomes each and every yield. Growers must take added care for scent regulation when cultivating near any individuals. Royal AK grows well in both outdoor and indoor locations.</p>\n<p>It has an odd, individual flavour; sugary and stale with a trace of pine.

It has an indoor harvest of 525 to 575 grams and an outdoor harvest of 600 to 650 grams per plant dried. The budding time period is between 8-9 weeks.</p>\n<p>The inside stature for this strain is from 80 cm to 140 cm. The outside stature is to a certain degree larger with a minimum of 130 cm to 170 cm.

The buds are not as dense as some other auto-flowering varieties that are more Indica dominant. However, the yields are of a good quality and each plant can produce up to 170 gr. if grown well.</p>\n<p>Like all of Royal Queen Seeds strains, Royal Kush Automatic seeds are feminized, which makes growing it even easier.

With eight weeks until flowering, they're on the early end of the growing period. Indoors, they grow to an easy-to-handle range of 60 centimetres to one metre in height. With a typical climate-controlled set up, they'll produce between 400 and 450 grams of resin from one square metre of crops.</p>\n<p>If you prefer an outdoor setting and have the right conditions, you can expect plants of between one and just under one-and-a-half metres in height. This makes them relatively compact for the grower. In this situation, they'll yield up to 500 grams from each plant and are ready for harvest in October. With a heritage that's mostly indica, it's no surprise Royal Madre has a strong Cannabinoid content and dense form. Both of its parents, Jack the Reaper and Queen Madre, have been described as fruity-tasting. Expect the same flavour here.</p>"

Not only is it lightning fast but it is extremely resinous and potent to match.

With restrictive potting, the plants stay short, entering the flowering period early, and speed like a train until the finish.</p>\n<p>The flowers are rock hard, really easy to trim, great flower to leaf ratio, and showered with crystals. For an auto so fast you would expect there to be a compromise somewhere, but there really isn't. Sour Crack was tested by alpha-cat (www.alpha-cat.org) and the result was 19.5% thc.</p>"

    "description": "Hubbabubbasmelloscope is a very special part of Mephisto Genetics collection. Many years ago Bubblegum was the first Amsterdam cannabis we experienced, and so holds a sentimental reason to them. A couple of years ago they were lucky enough to be given a very special bubblegum cutting of 90â€™s serious seeds origin. Years later, several hundred plants were grown to find a matching high quality bubblegum smelling male to mate her with, but none matched her so she remains as an elite cutting..as a photoperiod. Mephisto Genetics crossed her to one of their high quality auto parents that is a good balance between indica and sativa. The results of this pairing have really made them happy! The bubblegum smell and taste is dominant amongst a high proportion. There are Indica and Sativa phenotypes but the inbetween phenotypes are their favourite. She likes to get big! Plants love to branch into the typical Christmas tree pattern, and she can exceed 100 cm tall and wide to match in the right conditions. The buds are generally compact, and there are A LOT of them. So yields are splendid. She doesn't waste trichomes on fan leaves, however the buds late in flower are totally encrusted in resin. She can also purple up when shown cold temperatures. \nMephisto Genetics have recorded a good resistance to mould. Great candidate for training if your space is limited. She oozes taste, smell and an amazing sweet flavour, she has a euphoric giggly and creative effect, sheâ€™s their go to girl for a social party. Mephisto Genetics are yet to have her analysed for thc content, but they have high hopes.\n\nIn a good environment, 60+g is easily achievable."

    "description": "24 carat is Mephisto Genetics most Afghanica automatic, it was thier answer to an improved Autoflower SOG strain. They used a selected cut of BOGâ€™s Sour boggle (Sour Bubble x Bogglegum Monster Pheno) and began selectively breeding to achieve an excellent Automatic variety of connoisseur quality. She is a heavy hitter, that produces EXTREMELY dense buds, fan leaves can grow to the size of dinner plates, smaller fan leaves and stems that are coated with thick resin.\n\nShe exhibits pink and purple phenotypes so is beautiful as well as potent. She grows 50-70cm tall as a little bush if given the space (you can also pack these tightly together for an amazingly productive sea-of green) She is stout with a thick stem, branches and tight internodes, because of this she has a very high bud to plant ratio. She is a real stinker, so be careful and always use a Carbon Filter. She is also Mephisto Genetics most medicinal strain, helpful for sleep and aches and pains, and appetite stimulation.\n\n24 carat was tested by alpha-cat (www.alpha-cat.org) and the result was 15% thc.\n\nExpect at least 50g of dense frosty goodness when treated well."

    "description": "Sour bubbly is a killer combination of two of Mephisto Genetics best strains. The best qualities from each of the parents shine through. They took a 24 carat female (Sour boggle cut x purple indica auto) and hit her with some Hubbabubbasmelloscope male pollen (Bubblegum cut x w.w auto). The result is a hybrid with fantastic vigour from the hubbabubbasmelloscope, even in restrictive pots she can reach 120cm. But the buds are 24 carat dominant, Sour, hard and dripping with resin. She is an amazing hashplant! Stems, fan leaves, everywhere, completely covered with trichomes! Late in flower her buds look grey with crystals. The smell is sour, strong but with a hint of the bubblegum sweetness in there.\nThe buds are fat, and she has the potential to really yield! If you spot a plant that is kicking into flower a little later than the other girls, train her if you havenâ€™t got space, as she has an extra weeks veg time you can make the most of it and get an even higher yield. When she kicks into flower she really goes for it. Sour bubbly is the best of both, she gets big but finishes quickly, and the buds are of impeccable quality. You really canâ€™t go wrong with this lady. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nSour Bubbly was tested by alpha-cat (www.alpha-cat.org) and the result was 19.5% thc.\n\nTreat her kindly and you can achieve up to 90g."

So Dinafem decided to start a new automatic strain of Grapefruit that would create a fruity taste in the middle of summer without too many complications. The result is our Fruit Automatic, an automatic strain that includes Grapefruit genetics in order to achieve more flavour, resin and production as well as a more intense effect.  In addition, it is larger than other automatics and flowers in only 60 days.  It produces the most abundant sweet-smelling resin, dense plants with thick Indica leaves, and buds as sticky as honey.  The smell that this plant emits makes it irresistible. It is a variety that stands cold weather fairly well."

Its results outdoors are legendary.\n\nA hybrid with sativa structure, flavour and effects, but after crossing with Black Domina, the production is improved and flowering periods are shortened to 58-62 days. The plant has an excellent calyx-to-leaf ratio and from the first few weeks of flowering becomes covered with a thick and abundant coat of resin.\n\nThe smell given off by the stems when rubbed is particularly striking. Outdoors the plant will reach 2 m high, although this is made up with its lateral growth. By topping you can achieve a large number of strong branches and hundreds of cuttings. The EC can be increased gradually, week by week, leading to tightly compact flowers."

    "description": "Its name says it all. This is a hybrid of the famous New York Diesel (original Chem- Draw from California) which Kannabia crossed with Black Domina to reduce the flowering period and compact the flowers in the Domina style.\n\nWhen growing your first Diesel Glue crop, you should bear in mind that it can easily reach a considerable size in next to no time, and remember that because of its hybrid structure the plant will grow several centimeters once the flowering starts.\n\nWhen flowering, the plant demands large amounts of fertilizer. Although the lemon-green colour of the leaves may mislead you into thinking that it needs more, this is not usually the case. Try to keep the EC levels during flowering between 1.8 and 2.2, so as not to over-fertilize the plant and saturate the roots. Diesel Glue will be ready in 8 weeks, although certain seeds may need another week to reinforce the flavour and ripen properly. Outdoors harvest is during the second week of October."

    "description": "This hybrid stands out in terms of both yield and flavour, now definitely one of the plus points of this variety. It tends to stretch out although it wonâ€™t grow to a great height. Outdoors the plant is unlikely to grow over 1.80 meters, but you should use a support system to prevent the large central bud and the heavy side branches from bending too much.\n\nAmong its popular genetics we can find Bubblegum and Chronic, strains with deep sweet and earthy aromas during flowering periods.\n\nThis is a very easy-to-grow plant, since the variety is very robust and highly resistant to pests. Indoors, excellent results are obtained growing in five-litre pots, with coconut and a drain-to-waste drip watering system. The plants should grow no taller than 60-70 cm for an abundant yield. The flowering cycle ends after 55-60 days. Outdoors, you should be ready to cut it by the end of September, to avoid the first autumn rain."

Easy to grow, it endures all sorts of plagues and cultivation systems, optimizing its potential if you keep the EC under 2.2 during the flowering period. It has a classic structure with a fir-type shape. Outdoors, lower branches reach a considerable size and produce a great amount of flowers, developing compact and resinous buds. The effect is mostly relaxing, although it also causes short euphoric moments, resulting in instants of â€˜hysterical laughterâ€™. Gypsy KushÂ´s levels of THC are pretty high too and can lead to psychedelic effects."

This plant shows all its potential outdoors because, although its height can exceed 2 metres of pure buds, you will be able to harvest it in mid-late September. During tests, some specimens were ready in a little over 6 weeks, although 7 weeks is recommended for a proper ripening of all the trichomes.

The seed turns into whitish, what may surprise, although this is absolutely normal according to its genotype. You will have in your hand a pale seed, a fruit waiting for ripening. Flowers have a big size, and could become huge due to the influence of Black Domina. This variety flowers develop long, thick tails which look spongy. But they may trick you because they are really heavy and dense, Black Domina signature. The effects are basically relaxing but sometimes it may surprise us with more creative touches."

Its Skunk #1 heritage adds sweetness to its penetrating smell from the end of the growing period to the beginning of flowering.\n\nTo stabilize the plant, Kannabia crossed it once again with the predominantly Indica Black Domina. This cross gives it a shorter flowering time â€” eight weeks indoors and by mid-September outdoors. The yield is fairly high for a hybrid with a Sativa-type structure: around 500 grams per square metre. With a height of 70-85 cm indoors you can obtain an abundant harvest.

Although this is their fastest variety, some highly indica plants may even ripen and finish fully in seven weeks."

    "description": "<p>Big Northern (Kiss) is a much-prized variety in the English market better known to every cannabis connoisseur as Cheese. Due to the great demand and Kannabia's success on the British market, they decided to study and produce this seed in their honour. It&rsquo;s a plant that adapts very well to the Spanish climate, with its key plus point being its flavour.</p>\n<p>Kiss is synonymous with good, flavoursome marijuana. It is yet to be confirmed, but among its relatives are believed to be included Northern Light and Skunk. Due to the heritage of the White Widow, a plant introduced due to its roasted, deep flavours, the flowering cycle will extend in some plants, and they will be ready for harvest in 8 weeks. Outdoors the plant will be completely ready the first weeks of October. It smells like cheese, as you would expect!</p>"

This is the result of a cross between our only Thai variety in our mother room and Black Domina, resulting in an incredible eruption of flavours and smells.\n\nThe plant has a Sativa effect but with marked indica-type behaviour. The Thai tendency to longer flowering periods was reduced to 8-9 weeks thanks to the legacy of Black Domina in the cross, which also added stability and quality.\n\nAn electrifying high to start, growing heavy at the end, owing to this varietyâ€™s fine balance between Indica and Sativa.\n\nFor optimal growing, the plant needs good feeding right from the beginning of its life cycle but particularly during flowering, ensuring that buds harden properly and donÂ´t stay spongy."

A cross of Black Domina X Black Domina, a wonder of nature whose genetics have been improved generation after generation. This plant is almost 100% Indica, with a vigorous growth that is evident from the very first shoots. A large central bud with the other â€œarmsâ€ up high, from which several rock-hard buds will sprout. Outdoors the plant never exceeds 2 m tall, and indoors once it reaches 35-40 cm you can move on to flowering for optimal results. The indoor flowering cycle when grown indoors is 50- 55 days, while outdoors the plants will be ready for harvest by mid-September.\n\nIts resin production is spectacular and the THC levels that you can obtain will make you an instant fan of the variety. The smell is reminiscent of pine mixed with tangy fruits during flowering. For optimal growing, the plant needs good feeding right from the beginning of its life cycle but particularly during flowering, ensuring that buds harden properly and donÂ´t stay spongy."

The plant is of medium-height with a short internodal distance and a continuous production of buds and broad leaves of an intense dark green colour (mini Indicas) which flowers with purple and bluish tonalities. This cross produces a variety which is easy-to-grow but quite sensitive to over fertilization."

    "description": "This kush blend is an indica dominant strain that grows to a medium height, ideal for growing in somewhat limited spaces. However, it produces excellent yield for its size, giving an average of 500-550 grams per square meter. This yield is largely due to its high number of flowers per plant, which in turn produces a higher number of buds. With a flowering time of roughly 55 to 60 days, it is also a wonderfully quick hybrid, allowing for quick turnaround.\n\nCritical Kush cannabis seeds from Royal Queen Seeds will produce a cannabis ideal for relaxing. Its high THC content is excellent for relaxing both the mind and body, as well as relieving stress and pain. However, the strain is not so strong that it will simply render a smoker ineffective for a prolonged period of time. Rather, it will help to relieve tension and stress, while leaving the user in close to full vigor for any remaining tasks of the day. It is also an excellent before bedtime which will help to ensure a full night of restful sleep.\n\nCritical Kush offers an excellent flavor to go along with this pleasant, yet not overwhelmingly powerful, effect. The smoke has a distinct earthy quality, with an aromatic and spicy overtone. \n\nWith its medium size and high yield, it lends itself excellently to the small space or indoor grower looking for a way to get the most yield out of his or her growing operation.\n\nSo if you are looking for a new strain for a more enjoyable smoke, a satisfying and lasting effect, or simply looking to increase your yields, this hybrid may well be the one for you. Royal Queen Seeds offers the seeds you will need at reasonable prices. Begin your experiment with this excellent kush today, and you can see high yields of a quality, high level of THC in a matter of a few weeks."

    "description": "Like many other lemon strains, this one boasts a strong citrus fragrance that many people describe as sour, dank and skunky, yet fresh and sweet. Some others have likened the strains flavor and smell to a strongly lemon-flavored candy. This is most likely due to the relatively high concentrations of limonene present in this strain and ones like it. The taste is very much like the fragrance, which makes for a delicious experience.\n\nBecause this strain is sativa dominant, it comes with all of the uplifting effects that are typical with most other sativa strains. There is a considerable mind effect that is often said to be heavily psychedelic. There is also an increase in energy levels, creativity and motivation, which can be helpful when you have a lot to get done. The strain is frequently described as optimistic, euphoric and capable of imparting feelings of well-being. The main duration of these effects typically lasts between two and three hours, eventually giving way to more of a relaxed, yet still energetic, body effect. Due to the strongly stimulating effects of this strain, it is not advisable to use it immediately before bed as it may prevent sleep. \n\nLemon Haze cannabis seeds generally flower within eight to nine weeks depending on how they're grown and how well they're cared for. With outdoor growing, you can usually expect to harvest the buds during the middle of October. Yields are typically 425 to 475 grams per square meter, or upwards of 150 grams per plant, when grown indoors. When the strain is grown outdoors, it generally produces 450 to 500 grams per plant, but is reportedly capable of yielding 1,000 grams per plant with optimal care. Each plant reaches between 80 and 140 centimeters indoors, and 130 to 170 centimeters when grown outdoors.\n\nThe buds produced by the plant are often large and elongated. They possess a lovely tapestry of lime green with tinges of golden yellow that only seems to enhance the strain's lemony goodness. Like with most sativas, the buds are loose and fluffy. They're coated with a generous amount of red hairs and THC-rich trichomes.\n\nLemon Haze is a hybrid of Lemon Skunk and Amnesia Haze, both of which are sativas that feature a prominent lemon flavor and aroma of their own. It has one of the higher THC contents at 20 - 25% with a low CBD content of around 0.88 %. Indeed, the strain is so potent that it won the 2008 High Times Cannabis Cup, which greatly increased its popularity."

However, when crossing with Blueberry, the Blue essences mix among them resulting in dry and sweet-and-sour aromas which recall us plum jam.\n\nThis plant will bombard us with very cerebral effects, mixed with a significant muscle relaxation, which will be increased if we aren't physically active.  The size of the plant is medium- high with a short internodal distance and a continuous production of buds and broad leaves of an intense dark green colour (mini indicas). Flowering will finish with purple and bluish tonalities.\n\nThe cross of these genetics produces an easy-to-grow variety, but quite sensitive to over fertilization.

    "description": "<p>ACE Seeds Nepal Jam is another marijuana strain from Ace Seeds industry with pronounced Asian characteristics. She is a stable mostly sativa hybrid of a Nepalese female and a Jamaican male. By combining the best qualities of Nepal Jam's parents, Ace Seeds breeders created a strong and compact highland cannabis which is fast flowering and highly resistant to cold climates.<br />This marijuana beauty possesses all sativa characteristic except, maybe, her height. Ace seed selectors managed to control the genes of height and made Nepal Jam perfect for indoor settings. Her average height is not taller than 120 cm, she does well nearly everywhere. Her dense and resinous flowers, with a very good flower to leaf ratio, produce first class hash, in just 9 weeks of flowering. THC content is said to be between 16% and 18%. An intense and seductive woody fruit aroma appears shortly after first flowering days and become more intense by a harvest time.<br />Nepal Jam cannabis seeds also perform extremely well when outdoors. They are highly adaptive to warm or cold climates; sudden weather surprises don't affect her yield which is around 400 gr. per outside plant. The outdoor harvest starts at the end of September and is carried out through October.<br /><br />Nepal Jam sativa plants have lower CBD and higher THC counts which produce a clear headed, energetic type of effect, that lasts hours and hours</p>"

We thought it would be awesome to create an autoflowering OG Kush and tried many different autos to crossbreed the OG Kush to get the result we were looking for. Ultimately the NL Auto X OG Kush cross came out a clear winner. This was no surprise as both strains share ancestral roots.  The result; an OG Kush automatic that is a big yielding autoflowering strain with impressive bud formation and trichome production. Budstructure is quite similar to your typical Kush buds. \n\nThe OG Kush Automatic has a balanced high. A potent and longlasting bodystone that is also quite cerebral. Her aroma offers a lovely balanced acidity with clear notes of sweet lime with a lingering hint of diesel, revealing the Chemdawg origins of the OG Kush."

The sturdier, denser structure of Ice really thickens up the often light and wispy White Widow buds. White Widow's flavor, strength, and social high remain very present in this cannabis strain. Medical marijuana users are extremely fond of White Castle for its pain-killing properties."

It ripens very quickly, producing hard and resinous buds with hashy and coffee aromas. Fresh roast coffee and strawberry\\blackberry pie smoke fragrances, with a strong organic, hashy and earthy background. The flavour is reminiscent of the exquisite Yarkhun Pakistan hash. The effect is a relaxing Afghan type with good strength and high medicinal value.\n\nErdPurt is an excellent Afghani for outdoor growing in altitude or northern latitudes, where the cold, wind and rain doesn't allow most of the Afghani varieties to ripen properly."

You should remember that the plant will grow quite a few centimetres more once flowering begins. It has good resistance to pests and is easy to grow. Its lemon-green leaves may suggest all might not be well, but itâ€™s fine â€” thatâ€™s just its colour. \n\nIts buds tend to form a round, shape without tips and with a compact, strong structure. Its genetics mean that it produces a large amount of resin. \n\nHighly flavourful, with the characteristic citrus notes of the original Diesel a and relaxing, long-lasting effect.

At Kannabia it has taken us more than five years to decide to release a Critical, but we only wanted to do it when we had something that could stand out in a market that is already saturated with this variety.\n\nThe first thing to say is that all the plants are extraordinarily homogeneous. Their germination is excellent and quick to occur. But thatâ€™s only the beginning, because it is a very well-behaved plant that growers will always be satisfied with.\n\nAlthough it is an indica, of Skunk x Afgana origin, its appearance could be confused with a sativa when in flower. With lush emerald-green leaves and lovely tight buds. It produces a lot of resin, itâ€™s bushy, and its effects are strong. Owing to its compact buds and leaves, it is prone to mould, so special attention needs to be paid to humidity issues when growing indoors, and also pruning carefully.\n\nIts smell merges with its flavour, which is practically a mixture between sweet and fruity. Already only two weeks after flowering, its persistent lemon-sorbet aroma fills everything around it."

    "description": "This plant is originally from the Kuban region in southern Russia. The genetics are a cross of Kuban Sativa x Northern Light x Ak47. The result is an easy-to-grow plant with high pest resistance. Already in its development phase it shows signs of becoming a vigorous plant with a robust trunk. Itâ€™s large, deep green leaves suggest that it is an indica plant, but because it has been crossed with Kuban Sativa and Ak47 it has a long flowering period and a sativa effect. \n\nBuds loaded with resin, voluminous and compact with numerous ramifications. Its effect is long lasting, balanced between the physical and the mental. Its intense woody, spicy flavour gives it its own characteristic touch."

Grown outdoors, it prefers a warmer climate such as in Spain, Italy or California. Due to its relatively short flowering time, it can adjust to more northern latitudes (Netherlands); however, it will not reach its full potential as it would indoors.\n\nNo other plant from Royal Queen Seeds will yield as much in 7 weeks as Critical Feminized."

The taste is incomparable, strong, fruity, sweet and spicy with a Cheese aftertaste.\n\nPlants with clearly Blueberry predominance will turn purple when it's cold at night, but since outdoors it is harvested early, only in colder regions they will fully change their colour.\n\nThanks to the fast Blueberry genetic from Dinafem mother collection, their Blue Cheese is very suitable for outdoor growing because it is faster than usual strains on the market."

The blue line was selected outdoors, over several years, always focusing on quality and yield.Mould resistance and vigor were other characteristics taken into account to minimize problems in humid times; testing was done outdoors in high humidity conditions. The resulting plant grows like an indica-sativa hybrid, not like a bushy indica, reaching as high as 3 metres; it produces resinous and hard buds, with purple colours in cold conditions, smelling of fresh fruits and resin. It is a great producer outdoors, due to its size, and a good choice for high altitude mountain areas, where cold nights help bring out attractive colours. It has good strength, with a strong psychoactive effect."

    "description": "Blue Widow is an F1 hybrid of Blueberry and White Widow that was created to give flavour, taste and colour. The intense sweet &amp; sour taste of White Widow and the forest berry aroma of Blueberry, when mixed, create a blend of fruity sweets that smells like chewing gum. Due to its Blueberry heritage, in low outdoor temperatures this plant displays autumnal colours, turning from blue to purple and even reddish colours when the temperature drops even further. It also grows somewhat taller than pure White Widow, displaying larger internodal distance as well. It has great upward growth and can double in size as it starts flowering making it good for a SCROG set up.  Outdoors it can reach 3m tall which, along with good dry weight production, the precocity of the blue mother and the resin production and sedative power of the White Widow father, guarantees high production. It is a good producer of fat purple buds totally coated with trichomes, with a fruit chewing gum taste and a nice strength. It shows good mould resistance but particular care is recommended during the last two weeks of flowering, because the size of the buds increases significantly which can lead to the appearance of mould."

    "description": "California Hash Plant is a pure indica strain.  It is the result of an endogamic cross made between 2 sister plants of the same genetic line. They were selected outdoors, in high humidity and low light conditions, over several years due to fast flowering and high yielding traits. They also demonstrated that they were more suitable than the rest, with their good mould resistance. This ability to adapt to cold and humid climates is mainly due to the precocity of both parental plants, which flower within 45/50 days indoors; outdoors the fastest specimens ripen around 25th September and the last around 5th October.  California Hash Plant has a typical indica, bush-like shape, forming a well branched-out and wide plant that is not particularly tall.  The leaves are wide and dark with a short internodal distance, which improves flower production all over the surface of the branches. This is a good and fast producer making it a safe bet outdoors. It smells sweet but not very strong when dried, the aroma is mild, not particularly dense or fruity and more similar to hash or spices. It has a medium strength and a sedative effect due to its CBD content, quite similar to the effect of hashish, as its name suggests. It is suitable to be used as a tranquiliser, for patients with nervous disorders or sleeping difficulties, thanks to its low psychoactive effect, which calms more than excites the imagination."

    "description": "A legendary variety which originated in the UK. Its history is simple and, for many valid reasons, its genetics are the most well-known throughout the country. For countless people in the UK, an essential reference for knowing if a variety of cannabis is worthy is its comparison with cheese.The reason for this? Its intense, long-lasting and aromatically Indica taste of cheese,    something similar to a strong, well-cured, vintage cheese, the type of cheese that makes your mouth water when you think of it. Obviously, there&rsquo;s more than just flavour to this strain. The coat of crystals which cover the flowers of this aromatic variety is dense enough to induce you to smoke it rather than eat it with bread and a fine wine! It produces a well-balanced effect, a physical and cerebral mixture. Therefore, it contains a noticeable amount of CBD, which softens the amount of THC contained in the resin. With 8 week flowering and lush heavy harvests, it has been included among the Top Ten by all the coffee-shops in Amsterdam and awarded a prize in the High Times Cannabis Cup, not to mention the tens of thousands of &ldquo;Brits&rdquo; crazy about this variety. This all fits in to the scene of success and international recognition that it has obtained.Its aspect is languid, with long outstretched leaves and slim stalks, an heirloom from its skunk ancestry, but the flowers it produces are thick and plentiful and, when exposed to the adequate low temperatures, obtain a light violet colour.Destiny chose it to be originally developed within the safety measures of an underground movement in the UK, an alternative squatter&rsquo;s community called Exodus. In the 1990s, it became a centre for cannabis activities which was more or less tolerated by the local authorities and which resulted in a variety  which is now n&ordm; 1 in the UK. It can be classified as a highly commercial variety, comparable to Big Bud, Skunk#1, Power Plant, or Critical+, as these varieties, together with Cheese, are heavy yielders, quick and compact. However, what is paramount is that this strain captivates everyone that has the opportunity to try it due to its mild taste, medium effect and the overall pleasant feeling it produces."

    "description": "Critical + was selected by a great grower from Spain.  This plant won the 1st High Life Cup in Barcelona. The most interesting feature of this strain is without a doubt the intense aroma and taste that it produces; it smells like fruity skunk.  It must be noted that its smell is very strong and easily noticeable.  It is important to emphasize that when smoked, even mixed with tobacco, the original taste comes through strongly. It is really intense from start to finish and a real pleasure to smoke, leaving a great aftertaste. It grows like a sativa and it looks a sativa with slim, narrow leaves, not too dark, long and quite thin stems for the size of their flowers. It has a lot of side branching with a short internodal distance which improves production. It is advisable to control the height before flowering, due to its tendency to grow rapidly during this period. During this flowering period it shows all its potential, when what looks like a sativa becomes a super-producer that outstrips all other strains. It is great for SCROG systems; flower development is really fast and it is ready to harvest in 45/50 days with 12 hours of light indoors.  Outdoors it is also a great producer, flowering fast and ripening completely by the 4th week of September; it can have mould problems but, being a fast flowering plant, can be harvested without significant loses. It has high resin production and very high strength effect, which a combined physical and mental effect."

    "description": "Critical has become the most well-known variety of cannabis in Spain over the past two years. The reason is that the Skunk#1 genetics are dominant in this strain, which is also composed of an Indica variety of Afghani origin, a highly productive strain developed on the west coast of US, and which received the name of Big Bud.  Mr Nice Seed Bank commenced with this hybrid, naming it Critical Mass. It could be said that they became the &ldquo;godfathers&rdquo; of the most popular genetics in the whole country. Thank you, Shantibaba, Neville and Mr. Nice!  Dinafem owe them a few words of recognition because thanks to their hard work (and that of a few others), Dinafem have been able to create a truly popular seed. And now, it is time to try again, this time crossing Critical+ with the most productive sativa in the Dinafem catalogue of mother plants &ndash; the only one capable of flowering in 70 days, producing up to 21% THC.  The plants aspect is shabby like the sativa, with ample knots and very large light green leaves that hang limply. An explosion of flowers are produced, totally covered with large crystals of resin, in a much shorter period than one would expect with a sativa.  The crossbreed we have produced with these two elite varieties does not have the effect of a pure sativa, but it does have a fairly strong effect, the effect of the Critical+, fairly well-balanced; the modification increases its psychoactive side. It has an intense fruity flavour, but in some samples this varied to a lemony taste of wood. Very productive, even more than Critical+, an authentic flower producing machine, flowers which are very regular in size and homogenously placed on the branches &ndash;an heirloom received from its Critical+ side. There is a clear increase in strength, in exchange for a few more days till flowering.  Also, there is a noticeable increase in resistance against damp and fungus.  The result is guaranteed to surprise."

    "description": "Diesel is yet another legend created in the United   States of America. The history of this variety&rsquo;s genetics is too long to explain here, but basically it comes from the ChemDawg line, a curious strain that is said to need high chemical feed to bring out all the intense, long-lasting, rich sweet flavours it has to offer. When grown organically it&rsquo;s called Dawg and when grown chemically, it&rsquo;s called Chem  The strain, which made its way to NYC via a grower who got cuttings, crossed Superskunk x Northern Light, and came up with Diesel, named for the diesel-like smell of the fresh buds. This is one of the best selling varieties in the U.S., which says a lot for its popularity. The strong points of this variety are its distinct lemon-lime flavour mixed with tangerine and a touch of diesel fuel. In some specimens the flavour is extra long-lasting. This long aftertaste is the main reason for the success of this strain, together with its light, manageable Sativa high. In fact, the effect is light, not extreme or heavy, and fades gradually; it&rsquo;s also easy to handle since the anesthesia effect is not overwhelming. The plant is mellow due to its low CBD content; the high is much more cerebral than physical.  It is easy to grow, moderately mould resistant in cool outdoor areas, and presents no mould problems in Mediterranean areas; the plant is light green and does not grow very tall. Its excellent production makes it a great choice for outdoor gardens, especially if flavour is the principal attraction factor. After tasting Diesel, a well-known grower posted a description on an internet forum: &ldquo;typical Indica shape, giant resinous buds, gorgeous colours, smell almost too strong and sweet, good taste and even better Sativa high, but watch out or it&rsquo;ll leave you flat.&rdquo;"

    "description": "Critical Ogre is a new (2016) autoflowering strain with impressive vigour and strength. The initial goal in creating this strain was to the improve the quality of the Ogre. To achieve this, the Joint Doctor crossed the sativa-dominant Ogre with Dinafem's Auto Critical+ 2.0, which was selected for this purpose from among 30 auto strains tested in J.D.'s greenhouse in 2014. In the process, the Joint Doctor may have created his best auto strain yet! Critical Ogre produces large, tight buds, densely covered with resin glands. An ideal candidate for production as well as home-growing."

ItÂ´s an elite clone isolated in 1991, in the East Coast of the USA.\n\nThe clone is 21 years old and has lost a lot of vigor, leading to a declining production.\n\nDinafem found interesting the project of gathering the quality of ChemDog in the seed form and bring back the vigor and productivity that every grower wants.\n\nThe GuavaChem (or GuayabaChem in Spanish), is the result of the 4th generation of ChemDog stabilized, grown by the same breeder for many years and is very close to be an IBL or Inbreeding Line, a genetic line very stable and uniform.\n\nDinachemÂ´s aroma and flavor is eye popping, getting your attention right away.

The effect is powerful, clean, long lasting.\n\nDinamex grows rapidly. The structure is quite open and buds tend to be smaller in volume, but very dense and heavy, and decorate the plant like Christmas ball trees. Space along the branches allows light to reach inner parts of the plant, which facilitates the uniformity of the buds size through the whole plant.\n\nIt is harvested in 9 weeks indoors, and by October 10th outdoors, although there is a slightly faster phenotype that takes a week less."

    "description": "The first strain that was specially adapted to be grown under artificial light, was a cross between a high-yielding Afghani Indica and a Thai Sativa, and was created in the seventies in Seattle, Washington. This new strain was developed and established over years, giving rise to the first breed of cannabis designed to produce the maximum possible yield.  It was called Northern Lights (aurora borealis), a strain that has had a tremendous global impact, crossed successfully by hundreds of thousands of growers all over the world. The reasons for this were the ability to achieve greater yields in less time than any other seeds normally available. High yield, low height, powerful and few leaves to clean - that&rsquo;s what makes this variety a good example of quantity and quality. Pine wood aroma with hints of lemon and black pepper, powerful body and head high, this exceptional strain is the foundation of the haze and skunk crosses in Europe, and is one of the parents of &ldquo;Jack Herer,&rdquo; the best-known variety in history.  It grows with few side branches, wide leaves and a dark green colour, and most of the production in the main stalk; It has a typical Indica look &ndash; thick, sparse, very dark leaves and thick stems.  It combines body-head high with a pleasantly sedating psychoactive effect."

It is the result of crossing the best sativa and the best indica clones from Dinafem&rsquo;s mother plants.Moby Dick is Dinafem&rsquo;s most psychoactive strain with up to 21% THC and a higher than average THCV content.   THCV is present in equatorial sativas in response to the sun&rsquo;s ultraviolet rays.  It strengthens the effects of the THC.The low CBD concentration helps to make the effect psycho-actively intense and long-lasting.  It produces great hunger and thirst and has been used successfully by those treating the secondary effects of chemotherapy and anorexia.There are two principal phenotypes for this hybrid; around 65% are likely to be dominant sativas with the remaining 35% being smaller and faster plants.The sativa phenotype has a woody, pine-like aroma with the indica phenotype being noticeably sweeter.This strain needs a lot of light to grow to its full potential.  It also prefers a pH not exceeding 6.5.Outdoors this strain can grow to produce large yields when grown under optimum conditions.  It also has a good mould resistance inherited from its sativa genetics."

    "description": "In 2005 Dinafem introduced Moby Dick into the market and it immediately became a seed which produced passion among collectors; it was the first time a local feminised seed surprised collectors and convinced them firsthand that Holland was not the only reference in seeds. It was a first class variety, vigorous, productive and very powerful, with much better genetics than many of those available. The years have passed and it has become the most well-known variety in the Dinafem catalogue.Crossing a JYD Haze mother plant with another non-dominant and highly productive indica mother plant of the Northern Lights strain, Dinafem have managed to preserve its sativa character in flavour and strength but obtaining a higher productivity at the same time.  In order to do so, Dinafem have used the most productive mother plant of a special selection, a very stable and productive non-dominant indica. Thus, Dinafem have produced a new improved version which maintains the same strength and flowering period in spite of increasing its productivity. The increase in productivity is more noticeable in Mediterranean climates - as the sun is the principle factor which marks the difference. Harvesting is similar to its sister-plant, between the 10 &ndash; 25 October. It is moderately resistant to fungus caused by excess moisture in autumn."

    "description": "Power Kush is the most endogamic strain that Dinafem have developed. A single original mother plant grown over many years, the Power Kush has provided descendants which are all grandchildren of that one plant. For that purpose, S1 seeds, or self-pollinated first generation seeds were created. These seeds were cultivated and later selected, aiming to keep plants which were similar to the mother plant, which was an indica-skunk hybrid, used for commercial production supplying Amsterdam coffee-shops. The best two of these S1 daughter seeds were selected and their cross finally gave the Power Kush seeds that are sold.  The result gives greater stability than other breeding systems which, in addition to the vigour of the strain, has given us seeds with Skunk/Afghani genetics providing very predictable and commercial results. They grow well, the leaves are big, wide and long, so the plant can make the most of the light. They flower quickly, producing a harvest of buds covered in white and orange hairs, particularly popular in Amsterdam, an abundance of resin and a sweet skunk smell with a light touch of orange and strawberry.  The effect is physical and mental; the strength is astonishing but no real coincidence if we take into account that Skunk was the queen of Holland during the nineties and was developed quickly to produce great quality that has been maintained as much as possible to the present day."

Purple Afghan Kush rewards us with a deliciously fruity and high-quality strain, featuring calming properties, which guarantees the satisfaction of all collectors.\n\nDinafem are really proud to include this excellent Indica seed in their catalogue since it has allowed them to go a step forward regarding the already special fruity taste and flavour, which, accompanied by a physically and mentally relaxing effect, make it an incredibly appetizing strain. Purple Afghan Kush seeds grow in a small, resistant and easy-to-grow marijuana plant which flowers fast and produces dense compact as well as fruit-scented buds. This bush-shaped plant comprises very promising organoleptic characteristics and, when it comes to the aesthetic aspect, it acquires really beautiful purple/lavender hues all along the flowering period.\n\nPurple Afghan Kush performs well when grown indoors as it easily adapts to reduced spaces, but cultivating outdoors is still a great option in dry/sunny/temperate/Mediterranean climates as well as in a greenhouse, because its fast flowering properties make it less likely to suffer from moisture problems.\n\nThe flavour and aroma of Purple Afghan Kush are intense, with notes of freshly-cut pineapple. The effect is totally Indica, providing a pleasant feeling that leads you towards a relaxing and long-lasting state. It is the perfect choice for collectors in search of a cannabis strain that invites them to relax the body as well as the mind, and that helps them ease muscle tension therapeutically."

    "description": "High quality sativas produce clear psychoactive effects, without the feeling of sleepiness or tiredness.  The presence of THCV, a compound that makes the stimulant effect of THC stronger, and the absence of CBD are key factors to the length of the effect, as it can last for several hours, without the sensation of lethargy or tiredness. It is not easy to create this quality of plants whilst maintaining high production. Royale Haze meets both requirements: the effect is true sativa and it produces like crazy as long as its gets a lot of light, plenty of water, a lot of fertilizer, and just 70 days of flowering. 10%-20% of plants can manage 75 or even 80 days, but most of them are ready in 70 days.  The aroma is really spicy, with a subtle sweet skunk tone in some of them which is rich, complex and tasty. It can easily be grown outdoors, even in cold and mountainous climates of Southern Europe, as it is harvested relatively early towards the end of October. Out of the 3 sativas that Dinafem have produced, this is the best mixture of extreme strength, sativa quality and high production. It is completely suitable for a SCROG."

    "description": "MobyDick&rsquo;s sativa cousin Santa Sativa is equally demanding in terms of light and nutrient requirements but has a better quality effect than its cousin. It needs lots of zinc, iron, nitrogen, magnesium and a pH under 6.3, to avoid iron or zinc deficiencies. Well aired and warm soil is fundamental to avoid this kind of problem. It grows vigorously and quickly and needs quite a lot of space to grow properly. It adapts very well to SCROG and can easily be bent outdoors to limit its height. Predominant scents include wood and pine with a touch of spices, giving a strong smell after it has been cured; the THC level is very high, giving a strong and clear effect with a gentle somewhat physical comedown.

    "description": "Shark Attack is an indica dominant strain important for 3 reasons: the white coating of resin that it produces, its medicinal effect (due to its high CBD content) and its intense indica aroma and taste. It relaxes the body and muscles very noticeably, like hashish, and the effect is strong and pleasurable  It does not grow very tall; the internodal distance is low with this strain making it easy to control the size. The leaves are wide, short and very dark with an indica smell.  If you rub the stems there is an intense aroma offering a prelude to the strong sweet &amp; sour aroma that the flowers will produce. It gives medium production, ripening completely after around 55 days. If kept in total darkness for the last 5 days aroma and resin production will be greatly stimulated. The buds are white with a very pungent smell and the smoke is dense and pleasant.  Highly recommended for medicinal use, its great CBD content ensures deep and repairing sleep and it also relieves a whole variety of aches and pains. Outdoors it needs a dry climate to avoid mould and it can be harvested until 10th October. This strain is susceptible to mould in humid climates or after spells of rain.  The best medicinal quality is obtained by growing this plant organically, combined with a good flushing it with plenty of water and stimulators before harvesting it."

The name means \"strawberry cough\", it is quite expectorant and tastes like strawberry.\n\nA common friend of Kyle Kushman and Dinafem offered to bring them this delicious genetics from NYC so that Dinafem could try it and develop seeds. Obviously, they could not refuse such an offer. They tasted it several times and loved it so much that one of their breeders considers it one of his all-times top 5 favourites.\n\nThe genetic base is composed of a Sativa strain with a strong Haze component called Cough and an Indica strain called Strawberry, which brings the fruity sweet taste of strawberries. The Sativa hybrid predominance leads to a vigorous plant that grows well and keeps a balanced structure with short internodal distances. It blooms in just nine weeks and has a very powerful, clean, long-lasting effect. In addition, it tastes sweet and fruity, like strawberries, and yields like an Indica, making it a perfect hybrid that brings together the best of each of the two lines with which it has been created.\n\nDinafem have crossed Strawberry with Original Amnesia to add the sweet strawberry flavour and obtain a superior performance above most strains. The Original Amnesia elite clone dominates the Dutch marijuana market. It is the best Sativa seller due to its quality and high yielding. The best candidate Old Europe could offer to cross with a champion like the Strawberry Cough."

    "description": "<p>Sweet Deep Grapefruit combines two genetic strains which are appreciated for their extremely sweet and fruity aroma: a strain of  Blueberry  which is already well-known as it has been used in other strains such as Blue Fruit or Blue Widow, and a clone selected from Grapefruit, a variety that is known for its fruity taste, theoretically to grapefruit, although it reminds more of a sweet fruit like pineapple. This variety is very much appreciated in Canada and US.Grapefruit is very well-known in America thanks to its taste of pineapple and sweet grapefruit, added to its strength, yield and its outdoor cultivating possibilities, which has greatly helped production in places like British   Columbia, for example, where it has been used for commercial purposes.The result of this combination is an Indica-Sativa hybrid developed to boost its aromatic qualities to a maximum and provide a sweet, fruity, slightly acid taste.Apart from these exceptional qualities in aroma or taste, this variety provides lush heavy harvests as its branches form very regularly, with short knots, which in turn give abundant flowering.  The dense structure of the flowers produces a greater number of buds than in plants with longer knots. Furthermore, the buds are very compact and numerous thick buds are produced on both the lower, longer branches as well as on the higher branches. This means that the calibre of the buds is relatively uniform, in other words, the smaller buds are larger than in most other varieties. This, and in the flowering speed, is where we can see the influence of the characteristic indica genotypes in this hybrid, whereas we can clearly see its sativa ascendancy in its aspect, in the psychoactive effects it produces  -a physical and cerebral mixture- and in the complexity of its taste. Thus, apart from good hybrid vigour and bountiful flowering, which make it a highly productive and effective variety, it has a fruity taste of sweet berries.The &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; influence is noticeable in the colour some of the plants acquire, violet, purple, reddish.  Its strength is fairly high, combined with noticeable quantities of CBD, therefore producing a mixed effect.</p>"

    "description": "The White Siberian seed originates from a combination of two genetic strains subjected to a careful selection process throughout many years: on the one hand, a clone of the elite White Widow, very much appreciated thanks to its stability, heavy yield, resistance to cold temperatures in outdoor harvests and good results in indoor cultivation. Besides having an impressive coat of resin and powerful Indica psychoactivity, White Widow stands out due to its strong flavour : spicy and fruity with a dash of bitterness. It has wide, dark green leaves, moderate growth with a height that is easy to control and important medicinal value. In 60 days, a unique taste and effect are produced.  White Widow is one of the best strains of Cannabis ever produced and its high CBD content, together with other Cannabinoids, have helped it gain its worthy fame for being very appropriate for medicinal uses.Its partner is an AK47 which has also been specially selected for its excellent aromatic and therapeutic properties, as well as for its strength and heavy yield. This selection stands out due to its heavy harvest, outstretched leaves, light green colour, and it&rsquo;s sweet, fruity, sativa taste, added to a powerful effect thanks to a high proportion of THC compared to its CBD content.Apart from its vigorous growth, this AK 47 has also transmitted to its White Siberian descendants a characteristically sweet aroma and intense effect, somewhat physical and quite cerebral, which is greatly appreciated by medicinal users thanks to its long-lasting effect.To summarise the characteristics of the new White Siberian mentioning the best features of the genotypes that it is composed of: a vigorous, medium to high sized Indica-Sativa hybrid with a very good indoor harvest and extremely resistant outdoors. The White Siberian is mature, with flowering completed, in 65 days &ndash;outdoors in October. The result will stand out thanks to its shiny coat of resin, its deliciously powerful sweet aroma -with a touch of Indica bitterness- and its equally powerful medicinal effects.It is important to mention the medicinal qualities of this variety, thanks mainly to its White Widow genetics."

It is an indica-sativa hybrid with clear indica predominance, especially in the growing stage.  It is not very vigorous but  has many side branches making it easy to control indoors. The leaves are small, dark and shiny, whilst remaining quite wide.  The smell of the stems rubbed between your fingers is deep, sweet &amp; sour and very strong.  Production may be lower than for other strains but this is compensated by its resin coated flowers, offering very good strength and a mixed physical and mental medicinal effect, which is truly pleasurable. The flowering period lasts around 60 days indoors, which is necessary for maximum resin production.  If left in complete darkness for the last 5 days resin production will increase largely. This technique also increases the concentration of essential oils and flavours.  Be aware this plant can suffer from mould in humid climates."

    "description": "Crossing the most productive autoflowering with the strongest possible flavor was a matter of time. Critical+ as well as Cheese owe their origin to Skunk genetics, which is synonymous of high production, fast flowering and intense flavor. Therefore, Dinafem decided it would be interesting to try to combine both genetics.\n\nIndeed, Cheese Autoflowering has enhanced more, if that was possible, the intense Skunk flavor of the Critical+ Autoflowering, while maintaining the high production, abundant resin and rock hard buds typical of the Critical+ Auto.\n\nCritical Cheese Autoflowering tastes sweet and intense, like her parents Critical + and Cheese. Has a very regular growth pattern, open structure and large internodes typical of Critical +. Buds are dense, big, full of resin, and in the final stage carbon filters must be used, as the smell can become uncontrollable. If you are looking for a high quality and intense flavor autoflowering marijuana, this is your choice.\n\nMore than 1 meter tall and rock hard buds ensure a high level of production in just 10 weeks."

Buds are now thicker and tighter, denser and more orange, because they have dramatically increased the proportion of small flowers at the buds and leaves. The budÂ´s size has been increased too, they are now much larger, and the amount and size of the stigmas, which are bright orange as on the Critical+, has also been increased.\n\nThe aroma of Critical + 2.0 Autoflowering has reached the point where it is so stinky like her mother, a smell that brings back the legendary Skunk garden, but in autoflowering form.\n\nIt is far more productive than her little sister, because it is taller and has a very dense structure of lateral branches that produce many side buds that greatly increase the total weight of the plant.\n\nThe fat buds tend to bend the branches and some particularly large plants produce up to 250 grams"

As a result of using the best plants, Dinafem have managed to create a brand new autoflowering strain with an excellent aroma and taste, while maintaining a high genetic diversity that ensures an optimum resistance to pests and diseases.<br /><br />This Dinafem variety has a growth pattern characterized by large internodes, which favours a well opened structure, typical of the Dinafem Critical+ regular strain. Thanks to this pattern the light penetrates widely throughout all the inner parts of the plant, and buds are well sized through the whole plant.<br /><br />It reaches an average size of 80 to 90 cm when indoors, showing thin lime green coloured leaves, that is similar to that of her original mother. Dinafem Critical+ is well known for its extremely strong taste, massive yield and high quality sweet smoke.<br /><br />When Dinafem Critical+ Automatic enters the flowering stage, she looks like the original Dinafem Critical+: thin leaves, big buds, much white hairs, high calix to leaf ratio. In the final stage of maturation, the pistils are very orange, showing its Skunk heritage.<br /><br />It&acute;s not a perfect copy of the mother, but it is pretty similar. Anyone who knows the Dinafem Critical+ will be able to find the same characteristics in this autoflowering. Dinafem are proud of the outcome and have managed to stabilize the extreme fruity taste, orange sweet shades that has made Critical+ a supersales strain.</p>"

When grown indoors, expect her to reach up heights between 60-100cm, going from seed to harvest in as little as 8-9 weeks. She is relatively easy to look after, and can produce yields of up to 450g/mÂ² if grown under optimal conditions. Outdoors Fast Eddy reaches slightly taller heights, ranging between 80-120cm. She will soak up the sun, still finishing in 8-9 weeks and producing between 80 - 130 gr. per plant under optimal conditions.</p>\n<p>Fast Eddy produces a very pungent citrussy skunk aroma and taste, inducing a clear and comfortable buzz when smoked. It makes for a great daytime smoke - when you donâ€™t want anything too heavy, and you have stuff to get done. This light and functional high also offers a good degree of pain relief, making her a worthwhile choice for anyone looking to alleviate it. Fast Eddy has a 9% THC content combined with a high CBD content.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a light, flavourful, and enjoyable strain to work with, and want it with a lightning-quick turnaround, Fast Eddy has what you need.</p>"

This top-shelf strain was created in an extremely rigorous and intensive breeding program involving some of Californiaâ€™s best cookie strains. She is the result of mixing two exemplary Cookies Forum specimens, resulting in a Cookie strain so powerful it will bring a tear to even the Cookie Monsterâ€™s eye!</p>\n<p>Royal Cookies is a cannabis strain well suited to both indoor and outdoor cultivation. However, for her to really thrive outdoors, she needs to be grown in a warm climate. Thanks to her indica dominant genetics, Royal Cookies grows with a short stature, reaching heights between 80-110cm indoors. However, this doesnâ€™t impede her yielding potential, which sits at a generous 450-525g/mÂ² after 8-9 weeks of flowering. Outdoors, Royal Cookies will climb to higher heights, growing between 140-180cm tall. She is usually ready for harvest around the middle of October, yielding up to 450-500g per plant.</p>\n<p>The aroma and taste Royal Cookies produces stays true to the Cookies name, blending sweet and earthy tones into a pungent and tantalising flavour. The delights of Royal Cookies go well beyond her flavour, though. She induces a potent high that both uplifts the mind into euphoria and gently lowers the body into deep relaxation. Her potency is such that novice smokers may want to approach with caution, as her 23% THC content can quickly and easily overwhelm the unprepared.</p>\n<p>If you want large yields of sweet, potent bud that captures the very essence of Cali cannabis, Royal Cookies will not do you wrong!</p>"

It makes her well suited to growers with constrained space. As she flowers, Royal Dominaâ€™s buds become coated in a thick layer of frosty resin. She has the potential to produce up to 575g/mÂ² indoors, after a flowering time of 7-8 weeks. Outdoors, Royal Domina will grow a little taller, producing much more bud per plant. In warmer, ideal conditions, she will reach heights varying between 140-180 cm, and produce up to 600g per plant. Royal Domina is usually ready for harvest by Late September/early October.</p>\n<p>The taste and aroma produced by Royal Domina focus around earthy, citrus tones that ride a gentle wave of sweetness. The combination is mouth-watering, and one that connoisseurs will certainly enjoy. The effects induced by Royal Domina are potent, heavy and deep. She takes the mind and body into the far reaches and unfathomable depths of relaxation and bliss.

    "description": "Amnesia CBD cannabis seeds by Dinafem Seeds belong to a Sativa-dominant, feminized cannabis strain that originates from the cross of an Original Amnesia and a CBD-rich strain. Our collection could not do without a CBD version of one of the most popular strains of all time, the legendary Amnesia Haze, whose quality and personality are simply astounding. And being its extreme potency the only drawback found in it, we decided to reduce it so that it could also cater to those users with little tolerance to strong cannabis.\n\nAmnesia CBD is a marvellous choice for Sativa-lovers who are eager to enjoy the stunning organoleptic traits of the iconic original Amnesia but prefer a far more moderate and bearable effect, as well as for users looking for therapeutic properties. All this is down to its 1:1 THC/CBD ratio, which leads to a lower-than-usual psychoactive effect.\n\nAmnesia CBD cannabis seeds grow with great ease, and evolve into open and slender plants capable of producing generous crops of thick, elongated buds coated in trichomes. It must be noted, though, that fertilising the plant moderately will certainly improve its flavour and aroma. In a nutshell, a cannabis strain that proudly embodies all the traits of the original Amnesia except for its effect, which is undoubtedly more soothing; perfect to relax mind, body and soul.\n\nAmnesia CBD is a marijuana plant that possesses really deep flavours and aromas, with hints of lemon, sweet fruits, exotic wood and Haze. The moderate effect it delivers is slightly cerebral, ideal as an inspiration booster or even as a well-being provider. It cannot be forgotten that it has also proved to be really effective for fighting stress."

The result is a feminised, auto-flowering seed with superior yield, flavour, and effects to either of its distinguished parent strains.</p>\n<p>Blue Cheese automatic seeds are a flexible indoor/outdoor plant, flourishing in any temperate, high light setting. Because of the small size of the plant, it is perfect for a balcony, terrace, or other stealthy growing situations. It will develop purple coloration if nights grow cold before harvest; however, its early harvest dates make this rare. The yield is 325-375 grams/m2 indoors and 60 - 110 gr/plant outdoor. The buds are heavy, compact, and full of sticky resin.</p>\n<p>The plants flower for roughly seven to eights weeks and should be ready for harvest around ten weeks, allowing outdoor growers to harvest before night freezes begin. The short growing season makes it a favorite of people growing in chillier outdoor settings, as even a short summer is long enough to get world class Blue Cheese buds. The mature plant is small, but don't let the size fool you. Blue Cheese Auto plants enter harvest season heavy with sparkling, high THC buds.</p>\n<p>While the plant's specifications are definitely a plus, many growers want to buy Blue Cheese automatic for the gourmet aroma and taste. This strain offers a perfect blend of the parent plants. The buds are highly aromatic and can be smelled across the room. You'll notice a strong, sweet, fruity smell with a pleasantly skunky tang reminiscent of old school plants. The taste is of berries and spice with an aftertaste of mild creamy cheese. The plant has high THC and low CBD, with a moist, rich, aromatic smoke that has not even a hint of dryness. The high resin and THC content will make it a favorite among hash enthusiasts as well.</p>\n<p>People who smoke Blue Cheese Auto report a relaxed, uplifting high with overwhelming calm. This plant is often called cerebral or cosmic for its effects on creativity and cognition. It is perfect for relaxing after a long day or enjoying in intimate social settings. There really is no downside to this little beauty.</p>"

    "description": "For many experienced growers, this is the Sativa strain par excellence. This genotype is the result from crossing two Sativa landraces in origin, CBD Seeds has improved and stabilized it, to make it produce long and compact buds, increasing the final production and maintaining its resistance to mildew.\n\nKali Seeds virtue is essential if we plant it outdoor, because flowering lasts until November and it may coincide with the autumnal rains in the Mediterranean countries.\nWhen it is cultivated indoor, we recommend switching the light cycle to 12 hours not more than one week after the appearance of the cotyledons as it keeps growing during the flowering. If not, it can get too tall, reaching two meters of height, because it gets bigger and bigger during the blooming time. It could be a problem if it gets too close to the light."

At the beginning of flowering time you can see a thick layer of resin flooding leaves and stems. As it matures, the flowers take golden, orange and amber tones. The pistils gain weight rapidly to form compact and hard buds, and they are ready for harvest in 60/65 days. The powerful aroma and flavour of our Lavender will remind you that so popular fragrance. Its Aroma has a touch of other aromatic herbs like mint and rosemary."

This makes it very quick to pluck. The optimum planting density is between 20 and 25 individuals per square meter, because of the only central bud. Northern has been used by many breeders to create new hybrids, as it is one of the commercial strains available nowadays. CBD Seeds wanted to keep it pure to make it available to those who appreciate the taste of the â€œold schoolâ€."

Its flowers grow fat to form a core set with a length between 30 and 50 cm.\nWidow will surprise you with its smooth wine flavour with touches of sweet and wood, a delicatessen on the palate. This great producer rewards us with a considerable harvest with HPS lights. Outdoor growers are advised to take preventive measures regarding botrytis, because at the end of flowering, the buds take a cork type consistency, very desirable for fungi."

This is a long held genetic that CBD offers to â€œthe old schoolâ€ lovers.\n\nYumbolt despite belonging to the Indica family, it doesnâ€™t produce a single bud; it gives branched ones, with broad leaves and a medium flowering time, finishing in almost nine weeks. We recommend set the 12 hours cycle with a good size, because in the blooming period its growth in height is minimal. It fills the whole plant with buds covered with a thick resin layer, so you can see lots of flowers in the side branches and the central bud too."

Plants that have reached their peak can be kept below 30cm if  flowered as clones while larger plants can be achieved with a longer growth cycle. A renowned aroma and a sweet, fruity taste with fresh, spicy notes. Excellent resin production, produces a strong Indica stone combined with the Sativa high of its Skunk heritage.

The extra-dense buds give off a spicy odour similar to Afghan Hash.</p>\n<p>The high calyx to leaf ratio makes this a very easy plant to trim. Although not as high as a Haze, Lavenderâ€™s can get very tall on you if you give them a long enough growth cycle before switching to flowering mode. In Sea of Green, we recommend reducing the growth cycle to control height. This strain also thrives in SCROG systems. Lavender smells very much like Afghan Hash and produces an effect that reaches all the chakras. After a horrible afternoon at work or on a rainy day spent indoors, Lavender will leave you feeling relaxed and happy.</p>"

    "description": "Northern Lights is one of the three main strains that have revolutionised cannabis culture over the last three decades. Apart from Skunk #1 and Haze, no other strain has been as influential as Northern Lights. It was developed as an indoor variety at the end of the 70s based on Californian genetics. To begin with, it was a cross between a stabilised Sativa and an Afghan hybrid. It arrived in Holland as a clone but couldn't be used for stable seed production so they used Skunk nÂº1 and Original Haze to produce seeds and to provide mother plants. Northern Lights has a lot of Afghan genes, a sweet taste and produces a comfortable and relaxing effect. It is a compact, very dense plant and such a rapid grower that several generous crops per year are easily achievable. Its resin-capped buds smell like a mixture of honey and musk with earthy Afghan undertones. Low odour levels, easy to grow, great yields and exceptional resin production all combine to make Northern Lights a top choice Indica."

Winner of the High Times Cannabis Cup in 2000 and runner-up the following year, Blueberry is a real genetic jewel that was developed at the end of the 70s by crossing the vastly differing genetics of strains such as Mexicana Oaxaca, Purple Thai and Afghan.</p>\n<p>The guys from the Expert Seeds laboratory took both strains and crossed each with autoflowering genetics to achieve plants that donâ€™t depend on photoperiod while managing to preserve almost totally intact the taste and smell of the originals. These were then re-crossed to achieve our Blue Cheese Auto, which is a much bigger and more productive plant than first generation autos that retains the properties of its non-auto parents. In northern climes, this is an excellent option for early summer harvests while in a Mediterranean climate, two or even three crops a season are possible.</p>"

By combining the extreme potency of Northern Lights, a strain that was taken to Holland in the 70s as a clone where it was stabilised by crossing it with Skunk #1 and Thai, with the impressive production capacity of Big Bud gives us a mainly Afghan Indica plant that grows quite tall and produces resin even on its medium-sized leaves. The automatic version, which is a tall plant that can reach up to 1.5m, is an extremely potent, high-yielding strain that is very popular with both experienced and novice growers.

Its effect is very strong and will not let you think and creates a feeling of complete relaxation.\n\nVery INDICA in nature. Itâ€™s a medium height plant and is very productive, making it a perfect match for any indoor growth system and the SOG. You will be surprised by the size of its enormous and dense buds which are packed with resin. It is a certainly our most productive plant. Outdoors it will normaly be ready in early October but you must be careful as the size and density of its flowers make it prone to have problems with fungi."

Being ready in 8 weeks, it is a favorite for the Sativa lovers who can not afford to spend more than 60 days flowering. It is a medium low plant, where both central and secondary buds are big, fat, dense, resinous and compact. This is a high production strain. For spectacular production we recommend planting the largest possible number of plants per meter in indoors. A vintage sativa with an incensed aroma and flavor, that will make the palate of the most exquisite collectors of powerful and potent sativas enjoy.\n\nIts effect is very HIGH, clear and pleasant, ideal for leisure and creative consumers."

    "description": "Our Super Silver Haze was the BIO champion in the 2005 Highlife show in Barcelona. This strain has been with us since 1998, and since then it has been of the favourite HAZE strains in the country. It is a tall plant with characteristics of an authentics SATIVA, however it produces a bud volume of an INDICA plant; fat, heavy,dense and compact and full of resin. Indoors, although it would seem to be ready in 65 days, we would recommend you leave it for another week at which point it will be at its best, with its calyx twirling in.\n\nIts flavour is intense, metallic and has a classic scent of Haze incense. It has a highly SATIVA effect, which is ideal for when you are out or have things to do, not to sleep. It is a psychoactive plant which will stimulate your imagination. Outdoors, this is a large plant and copes well with fungal attacks. Itâ€™s an early plant, making it much appreciated by Haze lovers who grow outdoors in the northern territories of Spain."

Its dry and earthy taste reminds us of a moss taste with a slightly sweet touch.\n\nItâ€™s very potent INDICA effect will leave more than one completely blank, however its slight touch os SATIVA will ensure you are not completely switched off. It is a small plant, which is well suited for hydroponic cultivation. It has dark green wide leaves.\nIt is a medium production plant, but once its hard and compact white buds are dry, its shredding will provide more than any other variety. When its outdoors; it resembles a wide shrub with medium height, many branches and compact and resinous buds."

We however canâ€™t be sure because OG Kush first came from bagged seed in the early 90â€™s. By far the mainstay throughout California OG has many different phenotypes, this cross is Tahoe OG X SCBDx which has produced a heavy yielder with a beautiful terpene profile and high CBD content."

    "description": "Although this sativa shows all its potential in tropical/subtropical climates, it has also been grown with very good results even in latitudes 43Âº.\n\nFor indoor growing for small columnar plants or SOG, start straight from clones to 12/12 just a couple of days after the rooting. \nThis sativa is adequate for SCROG, horizontal or network growing due to its excellent yield in the lateral branches and its vigorous reaction to pruning.\n\nWe recommend low-average fertilizer levels for the whole cycle, especially Nitrogen."

    "description": "One of the most complete and interesting hybrids we have developed lately, that combines many desirable positive traits in one plant.\n\nIt's a very high yielding and easy to grow sativa dominant plant, with very compact structure, that finishes in only 8 weeks. It produces huge buds with almost no leaf. The effect is happy and kind, with mouth watering sweet and incensey aromas.\n\nNepal Jam x Kali China has it all. It's also a very uniform and versatile plant, both indoors and outdoors, making this hybrid an excellent choice for growers looking for high quality sativa hybrids with only 2 months of flowering time, for colder weathers or that can be grown in small spaces along with other short flowering indica varieties, without delaying the growing cycle.\n\nFeminized limited edition, improved in this newer version, using our best Nepal Jam (F6) and Kali China (F4) mothers from latest selections of both strains. This updated Nepal Jam x Kali China version shows more intense purple colors than the previous one."

Firstly, we have the 'white' pheno, with higher influence coming from the China Yunnan hashplant genetics, with more organic, earthy and forest aromas. This pheno matures producing a thick and shiny layer of resins all over the flowers and closer leaves, giving her a 'snowy' appearance that reminds us the best expressions of the white family from the 90s.\n\nOn the other hand, we also find the 'blackberry' pheno, with evident pakistani influence, that produces beautiful purple flowers with reddish hints, emanating a sticky and appealing resin that smells like forest fruits bubblegum.\n\nBoth phenos produce indica plants of remarkable quality, with a warm, pleasant and happy psychoactivity, and always rounded and 'mouth watering' aromas. The hash produced from this strain is exceptional.\n\nSince 2007 we have been exploring different combinations between Pakistan Chitral and China Yunnan, until we found the best genetic combinations possible between these 2 classic indicas from our catalogue. \nSnow Moon was born in 2013 and since then we have been doing testings to finally offer you this yummy limited edition in 2016.\n\nLimited edition available in standard and feminized format, while stock lasts."

    "description": "We spent some time in the Himalayas and the Malana Valley collecting and carefully selecting the very best genetics from the region. The Malana Charas was selected for its potency and hash giving characteristics. Crossing with the pure Indica Hindu Kush gave birth to Violator Kush, a heavy producing Indica dominant strain. This plant grows short with big leaves, big stems and well developed side branches, which will need to be supported. Violator Kush displays an extraordinary density of trichomes, with an amazing musty smell and taste. This strain will give an amazing and comfortable couch-hugging effect."

We used genetics from a combination of high yielding and resinous strains in combination with a new variant of Canadian Ruderalis. The genetics of this plant are worthy of study - the male parent contributes a reduced flowering time, short internodal distances, and bushiness that's typical for Indica-type plants. Meanwhile, the female parent has endowed C4 with spectacular aroma and flavor. The result is a strain of which FastBuds R&D lab is more than proud of, and that harvest after harvest gratifies and delights those who endeavor to grow it."

It is quite stable and displays a greater percentage of Sativa phenotypes, though it incorporates Indica genetics. The mature plant is thickly dusted with snow when at peak flowering. That's why it's named Californian Snow - the buds are so covered with resin they appear to be snowy like the summit of a snow-covered mountain that looms above a warm, sunny California valley.

FastBuds have managed to recreate an auto flower that does the original GSC justice. Theyâ€™ve selected the two most popular phenotypes of the Original Girl Scout Cookies and created an auto flower version of this spectacular plant. The result is an Indica-dominant hybrid (almost 60%), with Canadian Ruderalis and Sativa making up the difference. This plant presents a very undemanding crop, but like the art of baking cookies, take your time, Mother Nature can't produce such a deliciously minty, chocolaty product overnight!\n\nOverall, GSC from FastBuds stands out as one of the brightest and most exotic varieties in recent years, a true masterpiece!

Its chunky, resin-covered buds fill the room with pine and sour aromas inherited from its parent strains.\n\nThis strain has a great history behind it. From its beginning, Gorilla Glue #4 was created by Joesy Whales and Mardogg. It won the 2014 SoCal and the Michigan HighTimes Best Hybrid so, since then, it has been considered one of the best hybrid strains. FastBuds had the opportunity of triying the Gorilla Glue #4 and theywere very impressed with that strain; so, after getting the original clone of this awesome strain in a californian event, they couldnâ€™t resist to begin the research to incorporate it to their aufoflower catalog. FastBuds used a clon of this champion and, on its basis, they have created their Gorilla Glue Autoflowering. The result is an outstanding strain that can reach the 24% THC level."

Its taste is somewhat sweet with a decidedly strong aroma (hence the name) and it delivers a powerful, cerebral high effect. Due to the very high ratio of buds to larger leaves it is a strain that is very easy to manicure following its harvest and drying."

    "description": "OG Kush Autoflowering CBD by Dinafem Seeds is a cannabis seed that has its origins in the cross of an OG Kush Auto and a CBD Auto. She is, broadly speaking, the feminised, autoflowering, CBD-rich version of the world-renowned OG Kush, noted for her intense flavour and moderate effect. The Dinafem team has, once again, done a great job keeping each and every of the unique traits of the legendary Californian strain.\n\nOG Kush Autoflowering CBD turns into tall and branchy marijuana plants whose branches end up so laden with dense, colourful and sparkling resinous buds that may require the use of tutors to prevent them from bending. By nature, this marijuana strain thrives when provided with lots of light and grown in places with no humidity and plenty of fresh air.\n\nThe flavour and aroma of OG Kush Autoflowering CBD are unmistakable; fresh and intense notes of lemon and fuel make up the flavour that has for years conquered the taste buds of Californian users. Due to her high CBD, her effect is gentle, with almost no psychoactivity, reason why she is such a great choice for therapeutic use."

    "description": "White Widow Autoflowering CBD by Dinafem Seeds is a feminised autoflowering cannabis seed, with high CBD content, that has its origins in the cross of a White Widow XXL Auto and a CBD Auto. She is a fast and moderate version of White Widow, one of the top-sellers during the â€˜90s that is still today among the most popular strains within the cannabis industry. This fast-growing version is almost identical to the legendary strain in terms of yield and flavour. When it comes to the effect, though, she is far gentler. What many growers regarded as a utopia has become a reality thanks to the experienced breeders that make up the Dinafem team.\n\nWhite Widow Autoflowering CBD turns into dense and sturdy marijuana plants with thick leaves and compact buds. Her not being particularly big is a clear advantage for those who wish to grow discreetly both indoors and outdoors. And, as expected, White Widow is still present in her DNA, showcasing an incredible resin production that far exceeds the yield offered by other cannabis strains, in terms of quantity and quality.\n\nThe bittersweet flavour of White Widow Autoflowering CBD, with hints of flowers and citrus, is really pleasant for those who want to make a therapeutic use. Due to her high CBD content, she delivers a moderate effect that invites you to relax."

It has been picked and reproduced by Cannabiogen for more than 5 generations in order to get the best plant expressions and to keep a wide genetic diversity in the population.  The result is an explosion of colours, tastes and scents with two main phenotypes: one green and another very colourful.  Both phenotypes produce plants with a high adaptability, fast flowering,generous resin production and potent effect. The greenphenotype may produce a bit more potent and resinous plants while the coloured ones are a real show due to the forest fruits scents and the pink, red and purple colours that adopted when ripening. It is, without any doubt, one of the most beautiful cannabis indica expressions Cannabiogem have ever experienced.  Pakistan Chitral is an indica with a surprisingly resistance against fungus and rain, and also an exceptional breeding tool used to develop great hybrids.  It has a relaxing effect and the red and purple plants smell of wild strawberries and blackberries."

    "description": "Ace Seeds first Autoflowering strain! \n\nSativa/indica hybrid of excellent vigor and structure, producing a huge main cola and powerful side branches loaded with well resinous buds, its production and quality will surprise even the most experienced autoflowering growers. The first version of this hybrid produces 3 main phenotypes. The first, more indica phenotype matures in just 8 weeks since the flowering is started, producing an average yield. The second phenotype (the most interesting in Ace Seeds opinion) produces potent sativa/indica plants (with a flowering of about 9 weeks and a half), of huge yield, very complex terpene profiles, abundant resin production and excellent flower/leaf ratio. The third and final phenotype develops in flowering an\nalmost pure sativa expression (so it usually needs about 10-12 weeks of flowering), allowing the autoflowering growers to experience with very sativa african phenotypes, quite rare in current autoflowering strains.\n\nAuto Malawi x Northern Lights is more influenced by Purple Malawi phenotypes than other Malawi crosses, often showing beautiful purple and pink tones at the end of flowering.\nThe terpene profiles are fragrant and complex. The aromas in flowering can vary between Petit Suisse and strawberry yogurt (in the more sativa Purple Malawi phenotypes), and fruit juice (pineapple, pear, peach) in the better yielding green sativa/indica phenotypes. The most extreme sativa phenotypes have woodier aromas and a longer flowering time.\n\nAs usual with autoflowering strains, Auto Malawi x Northern Lights starts to flower after 4 or 5 weeks from germination, regardless of the indoor photoperiod or outdoor season, allowing it to mature properly in latitudes far from the equator, where the photodependent strains start to bloom too late to mature correctly. It can also be cultivated in mid-latitude climates, finishing in summer time when it is started in spring, months ahead of the usual autumn harvest of the photodependent strains. Excellent adaptability to indoor growing, where it can be flowered and harvested next to the mothers with a growing photoperiod, and thus to be able to obtain a harvest without having to prepare another growing area with different photoperiods, as it happens with the photodependent strains."

    "description": "<p>Royal Gorilla is an insanely powerful hybrid that, until recently, was only available in the US. With THC levels that at times well exceed 25%, she gives a spectacular effect of incredible relaxation together with a balancing uplifting euphoria. Because of her potency, Royal Gorilla also has good medicinal potential, which makes her a good choice to help with chronic pains and other ailments.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Royal Gorilla is one of the most talked about cannabis strains to come out of the US in a long time, quickly making a name for itself as a connoisseur favourite in the states. Her discovery, however, was entirely coincidental. Two breeders from the US, Joesy Whales and Lone Watie, discovered the strain after Joesyâ€™s Chem Sis plants accidently hermied and pollinated his Sour Dubb. Royal Queen Seeds donâ€™t know exactly what made Lonie keep some of the seeds when Joesy tossed the strain out, but what they know is that he later germinated them maybe just out of curiosity and what shot out from the soil was nothing less than the spectacular Royal Gorilla!</p>\n<p>The two passionate breeders immediately knew they had created something truly special, and were blown away by the results of their first THC measurements. As if a staggering 24-26% of THC wouldnâ€™t be crazily high enough, some of her phenos are said to have weighed in at an incredible 30% - THC levels which up to this date had never been measured in any strain before.</p>\n<p>As for Gorilla Glueâ€™s name, the official story here is that they choose the name because of the strainâ€™s insane resin production that made the two breeders stick to everything after handling their new creation. But given the strainâ€™s super-relaxing effect, Royal Gorilla can also be a perfectly fitting name to describe her deeply relaxing body effect that will â€œglueâ€ you to your couch, it also comes with an uplifting euphoria - making her effect awesomely balanced.</p>\n<p>Royal Gorilla isnâ€™t necessarily a strain that you would choose for her yields, which are in fact quite moderate - the focus here is on the quality of the bud, rather than the quantity. You can grow Royal Gorilla indoors or outdoors, where she will grow massive buds that will have wonderful lime-green leaves. Thanks to her strong resin production, her leaves will become covered with an abundance of trichomes, that will beautifully sparkle in the sun!</p>\n<p>Some of Royal Gorilla averages a THC content of 24%-26%, but certain phenotypes have the ability to surpass this when grown expertly. She induces a very potent effect that is incredibly relaxing - superb for chilling and stress relief. However, what makes Royal Gorillaâ€™s high so special is that this chilled effect is balanced with an uplifting and happy high. Her potency also makes Royal Gorilla a good strain for medicinal users who want a strong herb to help with the management of their symptoms.</p>\n<p>Royal Gorilla, which is a balanced 50% Indica/Sativa hybrid, has delightfully superb earthy and sweet tones, complemented nicely with additional notes of lemon and pine. It makes for a great-tasting remedy that wonâ€™t disappoint even the pickiest of cannabis connoisseurs.</p>\n<p>The strain has already won multiple awards, such as the 2014 Cannabis Cup and the 2015 World Cannabis Cup, where she won first place in the best hybrid category. In case it isnâ€™t already clear by now, Royal Gorilla is truly an outstanding hybrid with fans across the globe. She is well worth every growers time!</p>"

    "description": "Remo Chemo by Dinafem Seeds is a feminised cannabis seed created as a result of the Canadian cannabis grower Urban Remo and the seed bank Dinafem Seeds deciding to work together. Her origins lie in a Remo Chemo cutting, a cannabis strain developed by Urban Remo by crossing a UBC Chemo and a regular Bubba Kush male. The outcome of such project is a potent and stable Indica-dominant marijuana strain with high THC content (24 %) and remarkable therapeutic properties.\n\nRemo Chemo is a major achievement for the Dinafem team. With this cannabis seed, everyone can now grow a strain that until now was only available in Canada, in clone form. The highly reputed cannabis grower Urban Remo has been so kind as to put at this projectâ€™s disposal his favourite strain, UBC Chemo, developed by the University of British Columbia (UBC) for treating the secondary effects caused by cancer and cancer treatment.\n\nRemo Chemo turns into compact marijuana plants with a beautiful dark-green colouring that, at the end of the flowering, becomes purplish/almost black. This Indica-like plant, with broad leaves and heights of up to 250 cm, produces round and homogeneous ball-shaped buds overflowing with resin. When it comes to the best way for cultivating Remo Chemo, making sure the environment is dry and well-illuminated, and the plants are not overfed is the key to preserving their identity.\n\nRemo Chemo showcases very intense flavours and aromas, similar to the ones offered by legendary Cali genetics, with notes of Kush, earth, petrol and pepper. In accordance with her Indica personality and high THC content, she produces a highly physical effect of great potency. Therapeutically speaking, her effect is really effective in relieving the side effects of cancer treatments (nausea and vomiting) as well as in boosting the appetite.\n\nApart from actively participating in the cannabis field, the Canadian Urban Remo has created a line of fertilisers called Remo Nutrients: a range of products that provides their cannabis plants with all the vitamins, minerals and extracts they need to grow strong and produce top-quality crops."

    "description": "This original Blueberry strain is an Indica dominant plant which was first created in the 70s. It is famous for its enormous yields and great scent but primarily its amazing fruity flavour. Visually this plant is seriously impressive with its purple, red and blue hue which changes as it matures, after curing it takes on a lavender colour. It has a happy and uplifting effect which means that it is often enjoyed as a day time painkiller. Blueberry is often used by those who are suffering from pain, stress or anxiety. \n\nIt is not only a delight but an award winner; it took the High Times Cannabis Cup in 2000 for the best Indica strain. Blueberry is already extremely impressive and has only been improved on. These particular seeds are feminised, meaning that they don't grow into male plants.  The feminised strain has won an award all on its own and took 3rd Prize at the 2001 Indica Cup. \nFeminised strains are still increasing in popularity due to their quality, their easy to grow nature and their consistency. They were originally perfected by the Dutch Passion seed company and are now preferred by most growers. This is partly due to the fact that male plants can cause a number of issues for the females during the growing period. This means that they must be moved which is simply another unnecessary step for growers. It is possible for breeders to use feminised seeds to create a future generation of plants without and males at all. Female plants can be bred together using feminised pollen, this is quite a difficult process and should only be taken on by more experienced breeders. \n\nBlueberry needs around 8 â€“ 10 weeks to flower."

    "description": "Many cannabis enthusiasts see this Spanish strain as the perfect hybrid. It's easy to grow, gives a great yield and is of the highest quality. For those who don't have a huge amount of growing experience, or just plain don't have the time to put a huge amount of effort into their plants, this is the ideal strain. \n\nCBD Critical Mass plants grow extremely quickly and after just 65 â€“ 80 days of flowering time they are ready to be harvested. There are few plants that have as impressive a look about them; these plants grow to be enormous and impressive specimens that grow equally impressive and extremely sticky buds. The final product is super potent and generally Indica dominant. \n\nThere are few growing methods that CBD Critical Mass won't respond well to. They need quite a bit of space to reach their full potential, however they have the rough height of an average Indica plant which makes them suitable for growers who are lacking in vertical space. \n\nThe final product gives a steady, heavy, relaxing effect that is extremely couch friendly. It is often used by medical users and is great for those suffering from insomnia, migraines and muscle pain. It has a scent similar to the woodiness of tobacco with a little splash of hash. Many have even reported a pleasantly fruity after taste. For those who are just starting their growing hobby these feminised seeds are definitely a good way to go. Feminised seeds remove the issue of male plants which makes the growing process significantly easier for beginners."

    "description": "Of all the hybrids in the entire world Northern Lights has consistently remained a favourite amongst the cannabis community. This strain may look like a classic Sativa but the effect is distinctly and delightfully Indica. There aren't many other strains that can compete with its ability to produce so many high quality and versatile varieties. \n\nOriginally from the West Coast of North America Northern Lights comes from eleven varieties of seeds. Each of these varieties has been bred and re-bred a number of times over the years, at this point Northern Lights is a bit of a genetic mystery but certainly one of the best strains available today.\n\nIt is said that Northern Lights originated from an Afghani Indica and that other parts of the plant come from Thai genetics. When grown indoors this strain grows to around 3 feet but can grow to almost twice that when planted outdoors. The Afghan genetics really come through during the flowering phase; the flowers develop thick buds dripping with resin with one large primary cola. \n\nThe yield hits around 500g per square meter when grown indoors and again it surpasses expectation when grown outdoors. In order to fulfil their potential Northern Lights requires consistent warmth and light and if it is given all the love it needs it will grow into an enormous and high yielding plant. \n\nThis particular version by Royal Queen has by far the most impressive genealogy behind it. It is thought to be the product of years and years of mixing and crossing, its exact background is unknown. It is rumoured to come from an Afghan Indica plant and to be an Indica dominant strain despite itâ€™s clearly Sativa leaf structure."

    "description": "OG Kush is originally from Northern California and is known worldwide for its potency and its extremely specific smell. It is impossible to compare OG to any other strain in existence. Something that it could be a mixture of Pakistani Kush, Lemon Thai and Chemdawg but its true genetic make-up isn't known for sure. Some others think it could be a variant of Chemdawg from the early 90s. No one is even sure what its name means, some believe its Original Gangster whilst others believe that it stands for Ocean Grown. \n\nEither way one thing that we do know is that OG Kush is one hell of a strain. All cannabis lovers of all creeds and backgrounds love this feisty plant. The thing that really sets this strain apart is its scent. A dark, powerful aroma with just a little sweetness and a tang that finishes it all off. The after taste lingers playfully on the tongue and despite its Indica genetics its does behave like a Sativa. \n\nOG Kush takes about 8 weeks to flower and produces around 65 grams per plant. They can start out a little on the gangly side but they really start to fill out as they mature. They can reach from around 2.5 â€“ 3.5 feet in height. The buds that they grow are thick and drenched in resin. This particular variety of OG Kush is also feminised meaning that it is of a generally higher level of quality and of uniformity. Male plants can also cause a number of issues in the crop during the growing process. Removing them from the equation makes growing easier for the female plants and for the grower. However it does have some specific nutritional needs and prefers a sunny climate when grown outdoors. \n\nIt is thought that OG Kush was first grown in California which would explain its name. It is often used as a medicinal strain which can be taken by those suffering from depression, PTSD and Parkinson's disease."

    "description": "This gorgeous strain has one of the richest historical backgrounds of any plant around. It is well known amongst the cannabis community and is one of the earliest known hybrids. It was first created by Sacred Seeds in the 70s where it was released into Holland and quickly became one of the staple strains. It has a wonderfully cerebral and powerfully uplifting effect which goes on and on and on. \n\nOriginal Skunk was born of three impressive strains: Columbian Gold, Acapulco Gold and Afghani. This genetic background caused it to be the first stable hybrid. It has also gone through several generations of careful growing and breeding and is constantly used as a base for new hybridization projects. The genetic make-up of Skunk results in a powerful yet delicious smoke from a plant that has a short flowering period and gives wonderful yields.\n\nNot only is this legendary strain an excellent smoking experience but it is extremely easy to grow and the buds are of the highest quality. The only possible issue that users have pointed out is the smell. There is a very good reason why this strain is referred to as Skunk. The aroma can be extremely overpowering when grown indoors so it is important to ensure that the growing space is well ventilated. They aren't great for stealth growing outside, but if privacy isn't an issue then they are a phenomenal plant to have in a garden. \n\nHowever no matter where Skunk is grown it will grow well, they especially love indoor set ups and a regular light cycle will produce extremely high yields."

It has an extremely distinct genetic make-up which is often imitated but has never been successfully duplicated. No plant can really mimic the stability and consistency of White Widow, especially in its feminised form.\n\nThe scent of White Widow is extremely potent and only becomes more noticeable as the plant matures and grows. The taste is extremely fresh, clear and clean with the lingering aroma of cut flowers and ripe fruit. Users don't have to worry about a coughing fit with White Widow, its smoke is incredibly soft and smooth making it ideal for all types of user.\n\nIt's energising and invigorating as well as powerful, potent and extremely relaxing. Essentially it makes the user feel pretty great over all; every aspect of the strain is represented in its effect. Some people have even claimed that they feel significantly more creative, even inspired, when using this strain. \n\nThis strain was already easy to grow but this feminised version is even easier. Feminised crops remove the issue of male plants in the crop and create consistent, predictable plants. This plant is ideal for experienced or for first time growers who want a high yielding, high quality crop."

    "description": "Since the mid- 1990s AK genetics have been in demand by a large number of breeding projects. It's a beautiful balance of Sativa and Indica, although the Sativa side of the strain tends to take centre stage. AK gives of a very specific smell as it matures and has a flowering period of just 65 days from seed to harvest. This is due to its amazing autoflowering nature, this express plant is ideal for anyone who doesn't feel like waiting around for the perfect crop.\n\nIt produces hard, tight buds and grows to a height of around 50 â€“ 70 cm. Like almost all other strains it will grow taller outside than in, but this is ideal for indoor growers who don't have a lot of vertical space. For any growers who are planning on growing indoors ventilation is extremely important. AK has a potent and extremely distinctive scent which may become quickly overpowering. This is something that outdoor growers might need to keep in mind. However if privacy isn't an issue it grows well in a nutrient-rich environment with low humidity and consistent sun.\n\nThis strain also grows well in specialised setups. It responds particularly well to Sea Of Green or Screen of Green and other Deep Water Culture methods. This is due to AK's short, squat structure. It is wise to leave these plants for as long as possible before harvesting.\n\nAK Auto Feminised is consistent and easy to predict. This is partly due to the fact that it is a feminised strain. The flowers may take a little while to come in but after that growers can basically watch them burst into bloom. The autoflowering and feminised genetics mean that AK is excellent for novice growers. It is perfect for learning everything about cannabis growing and gives great, high quality yields even with some minor mishaps."

    "description": "Amnesia Express Auto Feminised combines classic Amnesia with a Ruderalis strain. The original Amnesia comes from a combination of Skunk and a Thai close which was crossed with C99 and Jack Herer. Amnesia is a multi award winner, it has taken 1st place in the 2004 Cannabis Cup and 1st place in the 2012 Sativa Cup.\n\nAmsterdam coffee shops are the ideal place to find Amnesia, this is due to the consistent popularity of the strain. The effect is ideal for medicinal users due to its euphoric and uplifting effect. Medicinally it is used by those suffering from anxiety, stress or pain. Visually it is a gorgeous plant with thick, glistening, resinous buds and its flavour and scent are bursting with citrus. World of Seeds has now made this amazing strain even easier to grow by introducing the Ruderalis genetics rendering it autoflowering as well as feminised.\n\nAutoflowering strains skip the vegetative period of growth making the entire growing period much faster. This also means that they can be grown to a much shorter height without the hefty yield being damaged. Ideal for those who prefer to grow indoors or discretely on a balcony. The feminised aspect of the strain means that growers don't have to deal with the pesky male plants. \n\nAmnesia can be grown either indoors or outdoors and is perfect for all levels of grower or breeder. The indoor yield can hit up to 450 â€“ 550 g/m2 and outdoors up to 200g/plant. The flowering time is only 7 weeks and the height is usually around 120 cm."

Northern Lights is an Indica dominant strain which first came to the forefront of the cannabis community in the 1970s. It was born in the United States using a combination of Afghani genetics. By the 80s Northern Lights was just hitting Holland and not long after it became the bar for cannabis all over the world.\n\nThe ways in which cannabis is bred and grown are constantly changing year by year. A number of new techniques have been springing up and this strain of auto-flowering feminised Northern Lights works well with every single one of them. It is ideal for indoor growing but also thrives in a warm, outdoors climate. The flowering part of the growing process begins straight away and the plant with be ready for harvest in just 7 weeks.\n\nThe yield on these plants is not to be sniffed at; often it will produce up to 200g per plant but will at least consistently produce around 90g. Usually the plants will grow to a height of 2 â€“ 3 feet making it on the larger side for an automatic strain.\n\nMuch like the original Northern Lights this feminised auto-flowering version has a relaxing effect with a deliciously sweet taste. Everything about the plant is the same as the original; it has simply been given the gift of automatic flowering. This plant comes highly recommended for medicinal users due to its high CBD content."

    "description": "Skunk is one of the oldest hybrids around and has always remained a favourite in cannabis culture. It was the first hybrid to be completely stable and first came into being in the 1970s before being released in Holland. Immediately it became one of the favourite strains of growers and breeders across the world. It has a potent but happy high and a long lasting yet cerebral effect.\n\nIts genetic background is made up of three strains: Afghani, Columbian Gold and Acapulco Gold. These strains together make quite the potent mixture as well as creating a tasty and aromatic smoke. It is Sativa dominant and has a delightfully short flowering period, for its type it produces impressive yields. Skunkâ€™s cultivation has been painstakingly performed over a number of years, these days just the word 'Skunk' is synonymous with good quality weed.\n\nThis strain is perfect for novices and experts alike due to its easy to grow nature and its amazing results. The only issue, for some growers, is the powerful smell that comes hand in hand with Skunk; it didn't get that name for nothing. When grown it will need a good amount of ventilation and outdoors it can really give itself away.\n\nSkunk can be grown indoors, outdoors or in a greenhouse and will produce high yields under any growth set up."

However for those who are basically clueless and just want to learn, this Express Auto Feminised version is a dream come true.\n\nA seed being feminised means that it will only grow into a female plant. These seeds are also auto flowering meaning that they flower automatically and skip the vegetative stage. This causes the plants to have a much shorter flowering time than most other strains. They can also be grown to a shorter height without the yield being negatively affected, ideal for those who prefer to grow indoors."

It creates large, resin covered buds that have a distinct Indica quality to them. The flowering period of this strain is about 7 weeks. Indoors the plant will only grow to around 50cm, a maximum of 100cm.\n\nThe aroma is a citrusy sweet and sour, much like the original White Widow. Royal Queen have ensured over a number of years that the genetic make-up is nice and stable in order to produce a truly superior plant. For an auto flowering strain is has a truly impressive yield, it produces around 40 â€“ 160 grams per plant. This does, of course, depend on the growing conditions.\n\nThe growing process has only been simplified by the auto flowering nature of the strain and on top of that this strain is feminised. The combination of the lowered flowering period and the lack of males make this a very easy strain to look after."

One of our frostiest, oiliest varieties we've ever produced and it's not all show, the Double Grape packs a mean punch too.\n\nBoth parents bring insane amount of trichomes to the table, and their distinctive individual grape based tastes combine amazingly to make something truly unique.\n \nDouble Grape has very nice vigour and grows with a relatively open structure, she will bush naturally, and with just a touch of leaf tucking even better. She will also adapt very nicely to LST and other forms of training when performed correctly.\n \nThe cycle time is medium at 65-70 days to bring her to fruition in ideal conditions and is definitely one of the most pleasurable strains to grow from any of our collections.\n \nDon't miss out on this one!"

As an indica/sativa hybrid, it is suitable for both night and day medication.</p>\n<p>Girl Scout Crack has a sweet, fruity aroma with purple leaves and a dense bud structure. Like both parents, the strain takes around 7 - 9 weeks to finish flowering.</p>"

Itâ€™s an exclusive limited edition pure Indica hybrid, with awesome yield potential and fantastic pest resistance qualities. Peyote Critical â€œlimited editionâ€ has been created by crossing Peyote Purple and Critical Kush. The result is an Indica hybrid that combines all the raw power of the Critical Kush with the notorious sweet flavour and colourful brilliance of the Peyote Purple. These two plants are perfectly matched, their striking similarities making this a truly harmonious blend. Both parent plants are short flowering, produce exceptional yields and are tough too. Built to resist, this hybrid comes with a natural force field against pests and diseases. Our lab was looking for a powerful plant with a unique taste and Peyote Critical ticks that box. One for the senses, you will delight in the sweet earthy flavours, and aromas of aged wood and sweet coffee. This plant is recommended for all levels of grower â€“ those new to cultivation but also experienced growers looking for something different. Powerful, sweet tasting and big yielding.</p"

We had the opportunity of trying the Gorilla Glue #4 and we were very impressed with that strain; so, after getting the original clone of this awesome strain at a Californian event, we couldnâ€™t resist to begin the research to incorporate it to our autoflowering catalogue. We used a clone of this champion and, on this basis, we have created our Gorilla Glue Autoflowering strain.</p>"

Big, long, dense buds are the signature of this strain, which spreads branches wide and far, more of a giant bush than a tree, and can net up to 300 gr. per plant in just 9 weeks.</p>\n<p>The final flavor is the genuine article: a hint of pine/cedar and tart sweetness that leaves a slight dry mouth as the soothing, happy vibes take grip. The final harvest gives off a fantastically pungent, citric aroma that really gets you sativating!</p>\n<p>It's an sativa - indica blend (up to 75% sativa) that gives an intense head high before mellowing out into a body high -- perfect for afternoon tokes. You won't be crashed on the couchâ€¦</p>\n<p>Blue Dream'matic is simple to grow, with strong resistance. A thirsty grower and potentially an early finisher. Trim the base gradually in the early stages for great consistency in plenty of bud sites, and a bountiful harvest could be ready as early as 9 weeks. However, some grows can reach the 11th week. Go easy on the feed â€“ about a quarter of what any product instructs. Control the height by trimming the main stem, and selectively defoliate to improve all-round airflow.</p>"

Ponytail her to get the side branches out & up and form some nice colas. Try 500 ml of feed every other day, from day 14-17 up to week 4, and increasing as required thereafter. 70 cm is a good height to reach, resulting in around 120 grams of bud weight. We recommend a bit of Low Stress Training to improve light penetration, and experimentation with light defoliation.</p>"

It is very easy to grow, being highly highly pest-resistant - especially to red spider mite - and not easy to over-fertilize.</p>\n\n<p>Outside this plant can become a real monster, easily exceeding three metres when sown directly in the earth. The buds are large and very dense, so keep an eye out for botrytis if growing in damp conditions. This strain has super high THC levels, up to 25%, which will guarantee you an intense, long lasting full-body high. Its flavour is delicious, sweet and fruity like gummy bears, its hit euphoric without being trippy, a happy buzz thatâ€™s great for creative day-time use.</p>"

Very deep and long lasting, both mentally and physically. Only for the harder and more experienced sativa travelers. Malawi x Panama produces consistently THC concentrations between 21 and 26%, and one of the most potent sativa alchemies.</p>"

    "description": "<p>The fastest and easiest way to produce a great deal of quality cannabidiol (CBD)</p>\n<p>Dinamed CBD Autoflowering is a feminised and autoflowering cannabis seed conceived as the quick version of Dinamed CBD, which was the first CBD pure strain of history with approximately 14 % cannabidiol to be created by our team of breeders in 2017. With almost no psychoactive effects, THC levels lower than 1 % and multiple therapeutic properties derived from her high CBD content, this strain was created for medical purposes. However, when marketed, we found out that not only therapeutic patients but also recreational users loved this plant that smells and tastes of marijuana but doesn't get you high like cannabis generally does. That's why we have decided to release a far quicker and easier-to-cultivate version of Dinamed CBD: an amazing autoflowering to bring CBD closer to all kinds of growers.</p>"

This next-gen autoflowering hybrid outperforms the competition in virtually every category of importance. Royal Gorilla Automatic is the marijuana that is changing the cynicâ€™s perception of what an auto is capable of.</p>\n<p>Indoors, the Royal Gorilla Automatic will grow to heights between 60-120cm. This larger size allows for greater bud production. Long-running colas and strong side branches will develop in optimal conditions. Yields of up to 400g/mÂ² are possible. Moreover, Royal Gorilla Automatic is an easy cropping strain that is low-maintenance and ideally suited to the SOG method. In just 8-10 weeks post-germination, frosty, Diesel, and Kush-scented chunky buds will be ready for harvest.</p>\n<p>Outdoors in warmer climates, Royal Gorilla Automatic can grow as tall as 140cm and become an enormously productive bush with yields of 120-170g/plant possible. As she can flower independently of photoperiod, Royal Gorilla Automatic offers the potential for multiple harvests from spring to autumn. Large containers, good sunlight, well-draining soil, and minimal nutrients are all she needs to thrive outside.</p>\n<p>Royal Gorilla Automatic is immensely psychoactive, boasting 20% THC levels and minimal CBD. As a genetic cocktail of indica, sativa, and ruderalis genetics, she has a combined head-body effect. Make no mistake, she packs a King Kong knockout punch. An initial euphoric and cerebral buzz soon gives way to a happy couch-lock. This extra-gooey marijuana with the expansive Diesel flavour is more than a rival to photoperiod strains; Royal Gorilla Automatic is setting a new standard of rapid-flowering excellence.</p>"

The ability to bloom independently of hours of sunlight means you can harvest multiple batches of cookies from spring to autumn.

They will be ready for the chop by mid-September. The prize is a fat stash of chunky nuggets with 25%+ THC and a sweet, fruity, banana aroma.</p>\n<p>Fat Banana is the Kush nobody saw coming. Mild initial euphoric effects and a mouth-watering sweet fruity flavour could fool you into overdoing it with this unusual strain. However, it is potent! A powerful physical stoned sensation will begin to creep up and take hold sooner or later, followed by an unimaginably relaxing experience. Prepare for the munchies - this is a trip to flavour country that begins and ends on the couch. When it comes to flavour, Fat Banana has a sweet taste that contains hints of citrus. As mentioned, the aroma the bud produces is reminiscent of its namesake, making it a treat for the nostrils.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Badazz OG Cheese utilises one of the very best of the current crop of OG Kush, viz. Badazz OG Kush (from rapper BadAzz), together with UK Cheese. It is 70% sativa which grows into a tall plant with slender branches and the typically thin leaves of sativa strains. Incredible terpene profile provides the opportunity to make some amazing extractions.</p>\n<p>This is a strain for growing indoors as well as outdoors in regions where the weather can be guaranteed through until harvest time in mid-October for northern latitudes. When cultivated indoors the plants will be ready to harvest after 65 days of flowering yielding about 500 gr/m<sup>2</sup>. Outdoors this strain can become very large reaching a height of around 300 cm. or so with yields of 800 gr./plant.</p>\n<p>The smell and flavour of Badazz OG Cheese is very singular and distinct, encompassing cheese, oil and spices all mixed giving one BadAzz sensation. Its high level of THC and low CBD produce an effect that is cerebral, euphoric and also quite active so absolutely no talk of couch-lock with this one.</p>"

The branches of this strain are rather spondly and it is strongly recommended to tie/train them in order to stop the large, spongy, purple buds from snapping them.

The indoor flowering time is 60 - 65 days with yields of around 500 gr/m<sup>2</sup>. Outdoors each plant will provide about 700 gr. of dried bud with harvest time occurring either at the very end of September or in the first week of October in the northern hemisphere. The buds are absolutley rock-hard and packed to the gills with resin.</p>\n<p>The smell and flavour of this strain is very intense with great complexity displaying pepper, lemon oil and a pure OG Kush taste which emphasises diesel. THC production is high with low CBD. The overall effect is particualrly intense and affects the body and mind. It has analgesic effects which may well be medicinally useful.</p>\n<p>Experience great US Kush genetics and see what the fuss is about yourself!</p>"

    "description": "Somango #47 is called to be a classic and was known in some forums as THE BEAST. From seedling it will amaze you with its complex development. It will get a bushy round like form, acquiring great volume very early. It has a very short internodal distance that will form strong branches that will keep up with the weight of the big flowers.    \n\nIt has an elegant aroma of fruity liquor with earthy notes. The effect is long lasting, strong and euphoric."

    "description": "Amnesia Mistery comes from a misterious genetics that give her an enormous size and lots of flowers. \n\nIt is a step forward in the development of the newest sativa genetics. One of the best selected Amnesia clon from Positronics was crossed with a misterious male coming from the greenest California valleys. As a result of that breeding you have an enormous size plant with one of the best buds never seen before. A delicious sativa for the experienced growers.\n\nIts strong structure allows the plant to develop more branches than average, producing lots of flowers besides the typical big cola on top. Needs a lot of space to grow, and will be the biggest plant of the garden. In addition to this, is very resistant to the fungus attack.\n\nBefore harvest it will smell like pine-tree woods, with menthol touches. Once the bud is dry will appear a spicy like aroma with tasty notes of coffee and licorice.\n\nAmnesia Mistery is of a strong brainy effect that will wake up your imagination."

Complex aroma will develop some notes of coffee and exotic spices. It will give you a long lasting and pleasant effect with tendency to creativity"

It is an explosion of unique flavours that only the crossing of these two genetics can give you. We speak of a very vigorous and robust plant with thick and very strong stems, dense buds and full of crystals. In cold climates, where the temperature at night does not exceed 12 degrees offers an explosion of blue and purple tones that makes it a beautiful plant full of colours in its flowering. It is a plant not very large, but if very robust, it is perfect for crops where there is not much height, it is very easy to grow and not need much care. The strong, intense, lasting and very relaxing effect is perfect for those moments of life where you just have to relax and enjoy.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Quick Critical + comes from the cross of an elite female clone of Critical + and an elite reversed (male) female plant of our Critical + 2.0 Auto line. The result is a mid-sized/tall plant with rather Sativa-looking leaves, ample internodes and branches that love stretching out, making for greater aeration and fewer moisture-related problems. Thanks to her Sativa-shaped structure, light can also penetrate more easily and reach even the darkest depths, allowing each and every of the flowers to fully develop. This morphology gives way to cannabis buds that live up to her motherâ€™s high standards: bulky, heavy, thick and resin-packed.</p>\n<p>Quick Critical + presents a highly physical effect. Mostly Indica-dominant, this THC-rich strain delivers a powerfully relaxing high that is perfect for a wide variety of therapeutic purposes, from relieving stress to alleviating muscle tension. This quick version is far more physical and couch-locking than Critical + because one of the most characteristic traits of autoflowering genetics is the strong physical sensation they produce. So, if Critical + was already a powerful strain, so is Quick Critical +, but with an even more intense soothing effect.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Dinamed CBD Plus is perfect for therapeutic users diagnosed with disorders such as epilepsy or inflammatory or neuro-degenerative diseases. Users who shy away from psycho-activity and look for relaxing and bearable effects.</p>\n<p>Dinamed CBD Plus is a sativa-dominant hybrid with abundant lateral branching and medium distance between nodes. Her hybrid-shaped leaves with jagged and mid-sized leaflets could acquire purple hues during the last phase of the flowering when the temperature drops by 10Â°C at night. A beautiful mid-sized/large plant on which to feast your eyes.</p>\n<p>Dinamed CBD Plus grows vigorously due to her sativa heritage and, although it shouldnâ€™t be a problem, it must be borne in mind when growing indoors. In fact, sheâ€™s so easy to grow that a standard diet should be enough. No need for great inputs of nutrients. After a flowering of just 60 days, sheâ€™ll be ready for harvest by late September/early October in the northern hemisphere, and at the end of March in the southern hemisphere.</p>\n<p>Dinamed CBD Plus produces heavier yields than her predecessor, with more cannabinoids and stronger scents. Her resin is also different from what weâ€™re used to. Itâ€™s less gooey, and this is down to her low THC content (lower than 1 %) that causes plants to produce less glandular trichomes and more basal trichomes. In short, incredibly bountiful crops of sativa-looking cone-shaped buds with a great calyx-to-leaf ratio.</p>\n<p>Thanks to her super-high CBD content of up to 20 %, Dinamed CBD Plus is the perfect anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and pain reliever. And, with such low THC levels, youâ€™ll be able to enjoy all her properties without being hit by the typical psychoactivity felt when consuming cannabis. However, this doesnâ€™t mean that Dinamed CBD Plus doesnâ€™t produce an immediate effect. In fact, her high will quickly take you to a state of total relaxation that, without being too narcotic, will help you soothe away your stresses and even fall into a deep sleep. All these features, together with the anti-epileptic, anti-psychotic, anti-oxidant and antidepressant properties of CBD, make Dinamed CBD Plus a therapeutic strain of great interest.</p>"

    "description": "<p>This strain is for sweetness lovers out there who need something a little more medicinal. The THC to CBD ratio is an amazing 1:1, it can even get up to 1:2. The effect is delightfully light and physically relaxing. This strain is recommended to those suffering from convulsions, inflammation, nausea and anxiety.</p>\n<p>The low THC to CBD ratio means that this strain wonâ€™t knock the brain sideways, and instead produces a high functioning but highly relaxing effect. This strain also has that classic scent and flavour of sweet fruit with just a hint of Skunk, spice and citrus.</p>\n<p>This strain is auto-flowering, making it ideal for all sorts of growers. Auto-flowering plants are perfect for those who are short on time and space. These plants will flower much faster than regular plants due to their shorter vegetative period and automatic flowering. This shorter vegetative period will also result in a shorter stature, but the same amazing yields. This makes them great for stealth or commercial growing.</p>\n<p>This strain will grow well indoors or outdoors and has a flowering time of just 8 weeks.</p>"

    "description": "<p>HulkBerry is the fusion of Coloradoâ€™s dankest cannabis breeding stock. The prized Ghost OG cut and the fruitiest Strawberry Diesel cultivar collided to smash open a new dank dimension from which Hulkberry emerged. Samples of HulkBerry have tested as high as 28% THC and were previously reserved exclusively for the top shelf of well-stocked Colorado dispensaries. Now, the most potent head stash in the world is finally available as feminized seeds.</p>\n<p>Under a standard 12-12 light schedule, HulkBerry will complete bloom, bursting with frosty buds in 9â€“10 weeks. Expect colas to stretch and swell significantly during flowering like OG Kush. But youâ€™ll definitely be surprised by fruity berry aromas competing with the classic fuel and lemon-lime scents. Even veteran Kush growers will be impressed with the heavyweight harvest potential. HulkBerry can smash a SOG or a SCRoG.</p>\n<p>The impact from just a few tokes of this herbal Hulk is phenomenal. HulkBerry turns into a monster upon combustion. Sparking a spliff is more like lighting the fuse of a rocket. Each lung full of brain fog takes you ever higher. HulkBerry hits you with a familiar earthy-fuel flavoured blast off, but just when youâ€™re expecting to descend back toward earth, the second stage rockets ignite for a voyage to the final frontier. While your body below is busy licking its lips and savouring the sweet and sour aftertaste, your mind journeys deeper into outer space. Veterans may have the tolerance to exploit the creative potential of the high. Most will enjoy a lengthy, happy head trip.</p>"

Treat yourself and the grow-op to the tastiest marijuana you can possibly flower in 8â€“9 weeks.</p>\n<p>Green Gelato is a slightly indica-dominant hybrid that responds well to pruning and training. Plants grow medium-tall with a very high flower to leaf ratio. Topping, fimming, LST, mainlining, and the ScrOG method are all highly recommended for max yield. Flowers form in tight, smallâ€“medium sized clusters rather than long-running colas. Cooler nighttime temperatures late in bloom tend to promote the development of lavender and purple colours in nugs. Indoors, Green Gelato will be ready for harvest after just 8â€“9 weeks of standard 12-12. Whether you grow organic or with hydroponics, make sure to finish with a thorough flush to release the full fragrance and flavour profile of these gourmet buds.</p>\n<p>By whisking the sweet, minty biscuit flavour together with the orange citrus twist provided by Sunset Sherbet, the delectably dank Green Gelato is created in a combo of fruity confection. Purple hues enhance the dense, orange-haired budsâ€™ aesthetics. Plus, a loud yet alluring aroma of Kush, baked goods, and forest fruits will bring most stoners close to sensory overload. Thatâ€™s before youâ€™ve even experienced the effects of 25%+ THC Green Gelato nugs.</p>\n<p>You will be shocked and awed without a doubt. In a good way. Green Gelato delights the senses before you have a chance to process the tremendous potency of the near-narcotic gas youâ€™ve just inhaled. The mind is charged with a pulse of energy and creativity. And your mood is unbelievably positive too, but the body plays jellyfish.</p>"

Indica/Sativa: 85/15</p>\n<p>Strawberry nuggets is a thick short afghan girl, she grows at a good rate incorporating a fat main stem and hardy branches. She produces thick green foliage and some of the widest fan leaves from anything we offer. She loves loves to bush and often will end up as wide or even wider than she is tall. Strawberry Nuggets does take some maintenance whilst growing to see the best results and yield. We would recommend several spells of leaf tucking to encourage the inner shoots to get out of the traps and race away. Due to her thickness she isn't the easiest to train but it's definitely possible.</p>\n<p>Strawberry Nuggets moves into flowering quickly so it's imperative that she gets a good start in the best environment. She develops thick white frost from early on and this frost builds and builds as she progresses. The flowers formed have a VERY high density so it's also essential to ensure good airflow and a low humidity level around her from mid-flower onwards.</p>\n<p>She's good for a low density SOG, we have run her in house always at 9 plants per light without issue. From our testing Strawberry Nuggets has several pheno-types that have differing level of colours, you can get pure green through to subtle pink hues then further ranging to pinks and colouration bleeding into the flower leaves, and rarer still we have had pure purple phenotypes emerging at a rate of about 1 in 10.</p> \n<p>She's a magical little plant to grow, with exotic fruity smells emanating from her combined with the high quality golf ball-like flowers. The resulting harvest gives dense nuggetry, super high in bag appeal, aroma, looks, effect, terpenes this strain ticks a lot of boxes. She's harvestable from 65 days from sprout in most environments meaning you can have a quick turn around of superb quality meds.</p>\n<p>Cycle time: 65-75 days; Size: 40-60 cm; Height/Width 50-70 cm; Yield: 60-90 g as a single plant grow.</p>\n<p>Sweet succulent strawberry, with berry undertones and a dank sour skunky edge. Medicinal, narcotic predominantly indica 'in da couch'. Best grown indoors.</p>\n<p>High medicinal qualities, eases sleep, aches and pains and appetite inducing.</p>"

When she gets into her stride and goes through the pre-flower/stretch stage, she will turn those branches into tall vertical colas.</p>\n<p>Predominantly she makes a large nugget on the end, but you can trace nicely spaced out flowers all the way down to the base of the branch. She lends well to different training techniques and doesn't create much foliage to allow for good penetration of light down to the lower levels.</p>\n<p>Overall we'd class her as a medium sized strain that has very good yield potential when grown in a loving environment.

The quality of this hybrid is really something special.</p>\n<p>She isn't difficult to trim and is rich in terps and has a smattering of resin all over her which makes her an ideal candidate for extract works.</p>"

She's also pretty versatile in that if you restrict her pot size she can be run as part of an Auto-flower Sea Of Green arrangement, due to being a more compact plant that can then also yield really well in smaller spaces. Gold Glue will benefit nicely from training, and if high humidity is an issue, because of the end density of her flowers we would recommend training to spread the flower mass across the plant.</p>\n<p>Gold Glue runs through the stages of an auto-flower pretty quickly, transitioning quickly from seedling, to pre-flower, to flower. However, once she's in flower, she flowers hard, creating large, heavy and dense flowers. She is also a very oily girl and a magnificent little hash plant.

    "description": "<p>Sour Crack x Walter White</p>\n<p>White Crack is a winner on a lot of levels, She displays decent vigour and with a little encouragement via some simple leaf tucking can become a really full bush of flowers. Yield potential is really high too, either she'll put out some very heavy colas, or if you've helped her to bush out she'll make a whole plants worth of compact crystally nugs just spread out between all her branches.</p>\n<p>There is some variation between pheno-types, there are some Sour Crack dominant phenos which stay smaller but thicker, however, they're bigger than the Sour Crack parent, and these finish the fastest. There's an average size phenotype that is a true blend between both strains, this is the pheno we're focusing on describing throughout this description. The size of this pheno is medium to large but it packs a lot of flowers, branches well, and the finish time is very respectable. Lastly, there's a larger, more Walter White dominant pheno with some extra hybrid vigour added in. This one will produce more yield but it's finish time will be later towards the end of the 75 day harvest window.</p>\n<p>The larger phenos will benefit from clearing out of the plant bottoms and inners in order to concentrate the energy into the main colas. Overall, this is an enjoyable, not too tricky plant to grow that delivers a spectacular end product.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Genetic Heritage: Gorilla Glue #4 x Grape Crinkle</p>\n<p>4 Assed Monkey is a speedy auto indeed, putting on flowers and putting out her sparkly oils from early in life. We would classify her as being on the smaller side of medium. When given room to spread out and a good environment she will yield well, but is aptly suited to smaller spaces or to be grown in higher plant densities. We would recommend some leaf tucking and gentle manipulation to aid her on her journey, but with limited veg time for the most part she isn't best suited to heavy manipulation and harsh training techniques. Aromas range from earthy with hints of sour initially that develop into a fruity tropical blend that is ultra tasty and salivating. Flowers have tight formation encrusted in resin. Bag appeal is top notch on this lady.</p>"

She has a bushy structure, providing lots of side branches for floral clusters to do their thing, which also makes her an ideal candidate for training. With some light leaf tucking her satellite colas can grow damn near as big as her main. While her branches are stout, they do tend to spread out as flower mass increases, so some light support is advisable under certain conditions. She has a typical to slightly increased node spacing. Nothing outrageous, but at the same time a nice nod to the sativa side of her. She has thin leaves that start to accumulate frost early and heavy, providing excellent source material for extraction. Even her stems trich over!</p>"

The flower formations result in golf ball (or often larger) round nuggets at the end of a branch, density is well well up there.</p>\n<p>Creme de la Chem is really a delight, both surprising and surpassing our expectations, she puts on a thick coat of sticky white almost furry frost, which contrasts beautifully against the cooler autumnal colours she puts out through her flowering phase as she gets her fade on. As well as visual appeal, she ticks all the boxes in the smell department too. (Read: Odour control warning!) Smells emerge initally as quite sweet to floral, with hints of incense and spice.

When harvested though, even immediately if you get your nose in there you are welcomed by a beautifully spicey musky cheesey aroma. Our Northern Cheese Haze automatic, was tested by Canna at an expo earlier in 2017 and a random bag bud came in at 21.07% cannabinoid content, and this was from a breeding reject with no special treatment or harvest preparations or even a ripeness check. So we think with a nice hand this variety could produce some very stellar results.</p>\n<p>The smoke is as you would expect, powerful.

True to her Californian roots, she boasts a delicious oil and lemon scent accompanied by a mind-blowing effect resulting from her high THC levels.

    "description": "<p>Master Hemp is a strain that combines the best characteristics of selected lines developed by Medical Marijuana Genetics during three years of dedicated research and breeding.</p>\n<p>This strain's most prominent genetic lineage comes from the classic and stable CD-1 strain, which offers one of the highest CBD contents available in the world today. CD-1 also holds a unique terpene content, which is often very difficult to find in cannabis strains. This contributes to the entourage effect, making Master Hemp a truly special therapeutic strain.</p>\n<p>Master Hemp also derives a number of characteristics through its lineage from a classic low-THC strain from Switzerland. This contributes to the strong and compact structure of the plant. Different independent industrial growers have been testing Master Hemp since mid-2017 and have recorded some phenomenal yields and quality flowers.</p>\n<p>THC content in Master Hemp is extremely low, generally recording between 0.3-0.5%. On the other hand, its CBD content ranges from 12-16%. A number of other cannabinoids is also present in Master Hemp, including CBC, THCV, and others.</p>\n<p>The rare and exotic combination of the terpenes in this strain contribute to its insatiable aromas of incense and lemon. Master Hemp is also visually appealing, with 30% of plants cultivated holding a deep purple colour in their buds.</p>\n<p>Cultivating Master Hemp outdoors or in a greenhouse is where you can truly appreciate the potential of this plant, as it can grow to between 2- 3 meters. It can be easily handled indoors as well, where a very light feeding Schedule and a 12/12 photo-period from seed to harvest is recommended.</p>\n<p>Harvest time starts at the end of August, finishing during the first week of September. It will take around 55-60 days indoors. Average yield per plant outdoors is 450 grams, with around a 400 gram harvest per square meter indoors. It&rsquo;s approximately 70% sativa to 30% indica.</p>\n<p>Master Hemp is a strain with one of the lowest THC contents of any seed available on Seedsman.com and is therefore ideal for therapeutic use and for everyday smokers that want to really enjoy the flavours and scents of a complex smoke with a non-psychoactive effect.</p>"

    "description": "<p>7th Wave by Super Strains is an Afghan indica with a difference. She is a strong grower that is highly suited to outdoor growth, the hardiness of this strain will make it a great addition the the garden and a good starting point for a novice. This strain offers reasonable growing times for a generous yield. 7th Wave produces a unique high that will tantalise and keep you coming back for more; it is different to any other indica out there -truly one of a kind.</p>\n<p>Whilst the strong genetics of this strain allow it to thrive in outdoor settings, 7th wave does just as well indoors. You can expect an approximate flowering time of 60 days for optimal yields when cultivated in a grow room. This combined with its generous yields makes it a great and viable option for commercial growers. The relative ease and quality of this product will also appeal to novice and veteran growers alike. It is suitable for indoor, outdoor and greenhouse growth. Plant heights can vary between 1-1.5 m and you can expect a fruitful yield of roughly 500g/m2 for your time and effort.</p>\n<p>7th Wave has an unusual high. Unlike most indicas, it does not give you a heavy physical stone, but sends you on a soaring cerebral high; however, this high also has subtle differences from those commonly associated with sativas. It is almost indescribable and must be experienced to really appreciate it. It will have you in a fine state of contemplation and introspection.</p>"

Getting rid of mould-infected buds is one of the most heart-breaking things to do in the life of any grower. With Turing Auto such issues can easily be overcome. It is a strain based on extra-sturdy genetics from Afghanistan giving these plants the hardiness they need to thrive and survive.</p>\n<p>Turing Auto has a life cycle of approximately 8 weeks but indoor growers may need to give some plants a few extra days, depending on the desired maturity level. It can be grown anywhere, indoors or outdoors. Guerrilla and outdoor growers will profit the most. They may expect plants that can deal with the harsh climates of northern Europe, and will reach a final height of approximately 1.5 m. The size is impressive for an auto variety. Harvests can be realised long before the weather changes in autumn, assuming growers plan accordingly.</p>\n<p>The taste of Turing Auto can be described as a unique blend of musky aromas. Smokers will get a long-lasting and strong stone, typical for Afghan genetics. The effect and flavours might be simpler or down-to-earth in direct comparison to some exotic sativa-dominant strains, but sometimes simplicity is the key. Especially when growing outdoors in challenging climates.</p>\n<p>This strain may not convince with excessive levels of THC, or crazy mango flavours, but it treats growers to a major growing advantage in return: the power to survive in tough climatic conditions. When a strain can survive in the cold mountain regions of Afghanistan, it can be grown almost anywhere.</p>"

This is a little longer than other AutoFems, but with this variety the extra time was needed to give the best combination of potency, taste and crop size.  As a result the plants may be a little larger than usual, up to 1.5m tall.  This is a new AutoFem and one which will be very hard to beat."

The connoisseur-quality AutoBlueberry parentage benefits from the potency and heavy yields of the AutoMazar genetics, this is one of the best automatics available today and one which they believe will be very hard to surpass.  Blue AutoMazar is ready to harvest around 75 days after germination and is 75% indica and 25% sativa.  This variety will produce cannabis plants which are a blend of both parent genetics, but you will also see some AutoBlueberry-leaning plants, and some which closely resemble the original AutoMazar.  In bloom she rewards the grower with a complicated array of fruit aromas and occasional scents of spice; pepper, earthy.\n\nThe effect is strong, happy and sedating on the body.  A comfortable and very enjoyable high complements a variety with great yields and numerous blooms which are heavy with bud and resin production.  Blue AutoMazar cannabis plants typically grow to 80-100cm tall and need space as the plants like to spread out. Yields for most growers will be 75-100 grams of top strength sweet-tasting marijuana, although the most experienced growers will be able to crop 200g++ from a single plant."

To create this variety our Haze/Skunk (winner of the 1992 High Times Cannabis Cup) was carefully crossed with a high CBD variety.\n\nCBD Skunk Haze produces large tall plants. This Sativa/Indica cross (50/50) produces large buds which are not too dense. The aroma and taste are of spicy cedar wood alongside tones of citrus, pine and mint. CBD Skunk Haze grows well Indoors and in a greenhouse. The flowering period is approximately 10 weeks and yields up to 450 grams/m2 are possible under ideal conditions."

Alberto is a Master Grower, Cannabis Connoisseur and owner of Haze Magazine.</p>\n<p>Dutch Passion's first project with Alberto was to introduce Desfr&aacute;n to Europe. During vegetative growth Desfr&aacute;n needs little nutrition. She grows well in soil especially with plenty of root space, and grows vigorously in other methods too. Desfr&aacute;n is 100% Sativa so she can grow very tall and develops long branches which can dominate the airspace/growroom in no time. In vegetative growth, the stem can produce intense fruity aromas when rubbed. During flower, she stretches and can triple her height. Desfr&aacute;n is very resinous variety suited for SOG and SCROG grow methods and usually takes 9-10 weeks to flower. It has a fruity aroma similar to pear and green apples, the taste is like enjoying a pear caramel with hints of grape and melon.</p>\n<p>Desfr&aacute;n produces unusually dense and compact flowers for a Sativa. When dried, the flowers look like glazed pinecones. Early harvest can result in a very cerebral and psychedelic high, but if you harvest Desfr&aacute;n late she tastes sweeter and is a true destroyer. Desfr&aacute;n is one of the best varieties Alberto has ever seen, and Seedsman hopes you will think the same.</p>"

After a lifetime devoted to cannabis, Freddy is retiring and as a tribute to his astonishing legacy his final strain is named in his honour â€˜Freddyâ€™s Bestâ€™.\n\nFreddy is a real connoisseur, he sets the highest standards for the high, appearance, taste and yield of his creations but in his final project he pushed these expectations to new levels of achievement..  \n\nDelving into the 30 year old Dutch Passion genebank, Freddy created a 3-way cross between Chocolope, Dutch Haze and a special, unnamed Sativa.  Freddyâ€™s Best is a mostly Sativa variety with a generous crop of large round buds which are dense and especially full of resin.  Freddyâ€™s connoisseur taste targets were met with a unique aroma and delicious flavours with hints of cocoa as well as earthy scents, with a sweet and spicy taste.  \n\nFreddyâ€™s best has a fantastically intense, clear and long lasting high.  This is a true connoisseurs delight bringing heavy yields.  Freddyâ€™s best is a fitting tribute to a remarkable man.  \n\nDutch Passion would like to thank Freddy for his dedication to cannabis and Dutch Passion and to wish him an inspired future as he follows his second dream, Shamanism.  Freddy, we salute you."

    "description": "<p>Jorge's Diamond is a unique resin-packed indica-dominant strain that is potent, sweet, flavourful and incredibly smooth smoking. The rare indica-dominant genes are mixed with just the right amount of sativa to give the smoke a very strong soaring long-lasting high. The exceptional taste and aroma are fruity and sweet. The insatiable taste is sweet and similar to wild honey smothered in raspberries. The strain is almost maintenance free, also spider mites and other pests know to leave Jorge&rsquo;s Diamonds #1 alone. Medical note: By Thin Layer Chromatography the THC percentage was calculated at 16 to 18%, while the strain (medical note) is high in THCV, CBD and CBN.</p>"

    "description": "After an absence of 10 years Dutch Passion are pleased to announce the return of Night Queen . Night Queen was an original 1980â€™s Dutch Passion classic, around even before Dutch Passion became a registered seed company. Dutch Passion's 1987 catalogue describes Night Queen as a broadleaved Afghani Indica which was popular with hardcore stoners for the intense body stone. They upgraded Night Queen in 1997 but sales dropped as growers opted for the newer strains and hybrids which were being introduced at the time. Reluctantly Night Queen was withdrawn from their collection.\n\nThey have had many requests to bring Night Queen back and so they did. Their goal was to re-create an Indica which would meet the world class standards achieved by their multiple award winning Mazar. The outcome was a crystal covered, fast early flowering and typically indica variety which is good for beginners and resistant to pests and fungus. The new Night Queen is forgiving and very easy to take cuttings from, a perfect mother plant. She is short and will suit indoor. The name is an accurate one since most of the plants are a very dark green, almost black. The females are quite special, dark, beautiful and with heavy harvests of frosty, hard and dense bud growth â€“ these are real Queens. High THC and CBD levels will appeal to medicinal intrests, as will the very generous yields.\n\nNight Queen is one of those rare genuine hash-plant smokes, a rich Afghani Indica heritage producing highly potent resin-frosted bud. Night Queen is a heavy yielder with all the earthy aromas one could hope for in a top quality marijuana strain with the addition of some spicy flavours that the old-timers and connoisseurs will savour. The top class body stone remains a key feature of Night Queen, this is a second chance to get the best ever version of a 1980â€™s classic which is on the same high-end quality level as Mazar."

    "description": "Orange Hill Special is an exceptional Orange Skunk selection, a new addition to Dutch Passion â€˜Orangeâ€™ family.  She was developed with genetics from their much loved Orange Bud and Californian Orange varieties, two stable customer favourites which date back to the 1980â€™s.  Breeding took place through 6 generations to ensure a stable and strong Orange Skunk with lots of orange hairs at harvest, generous yields and a citrus flavour.  This is 50% indica/50% sativa with a 21% THC level which produces a great solid, pleasurably and relaxing effect. \n\nPlants typically stay short, around 1 metre, with lots of sticky buds on the side branches.  This is the bushiest and best yielding member of their Orange family.  She takes 8-9 weeks to finish.  Outdoors in warm climates she finishes around mid-October (mid April in Southern hemisphere).  Yields are generous and can be up to 450g from a well grown plant.  This is highly recommended for fans of the Orange family, and everyone else, a genuinely special variety with great yields.  Developed and produced by the breeder who created Power Plant, The Ultimate, Skunk #11, Euforia and Master Kush."

OutLaw will stretch more than most, perhaps 50cm after switching to flower.\n\nAlthough she can be harvested as early as 9 weeks, a full 12 week flower period may be required for best taste, yield and high.

    "description": "Dutch Passion are proud to present the non-auto-flowering version of the legendary Think Different. Think FastÂ® was created by crossing Think Different AutoFem with a specially selected cutting of the Dutch Passion classic Power PlantÂ® in the search of new AutoFem genetics. The first generation offspring, which is normally used for further breeding, was left flowering and gave surprisingly good results. When crossing an auto-flowering variety with a traditional photo-period variety, none of this offspring will be auto-flowering. The Dutch Passion geneticists discovered that these non-auto-flowering plants, which carry the recessive auto-flowering gene are significantly faster than their photo-period parents.\n\nThink FastÂ® still needs a light impulse to start flowering, but grows bigger and taller in a faster way. With this feature it becomes possible to grow big, potent, photo-period strains with almost the speed of an auto-flower. Think FastÂ® can be grown outdoors and indoors and will reach the height of a photo-period strain, but will be ready to harvest a few weeks earlier. Think FastÂ® inherited the overwhelming big yields from our classic strain Power Plant and is almost as fast and easy to grow as the legendary Think Different."

First one, is a faster and more compact plant with an acid lemony intense scent, producing a good quantity of resin. In F1 form, the compact and medium final size continues to be seen and yield and resin production increases. It finishes in 75 days. Their second Swazi mother is bushier, perfect to be topped or bent if needed. Flowers are a bit more airy and form fox-tailed towers with lots of resin on them. Red to even intense purple buds are commonly seen in this last case. Sativa active effect starts creativity. Scents are in the spicy and floral side, with hashy undertones."

A complex bouquet that mixes fruits such as tangerine, orange, grape, red fruits, a delight that will not go unnoticed.

Expect a gentle blow of euphoria that goes straight to the head and turns into a nice feel of physical relaxation over time. Powerful, hard-hitting, and sedative, in true Californian style.</p>"

In fact, she grows upwards without having to extend the vegetative period, and her inter-nodes are surprisingly ample.</p>\n<p>Purps #1 delivers a clearly relaxing high. However, despite her high THC levels, sheâ€™s not devastating. Her effect is indeed cerebral and helps to flee the frenetic daily thoughts, but itâ€™s a trip with a smooth return.

Despite its great sativa vigour and its very high production, Killer A5 Haze grows with a contained and manageable size, making it our sativa dominant hybrid with the highest production per m2.</p>"

    "description": "<p><strong>Atomical Haze Feminized Cannabis Seeds</strong> by Paradise Seedbank of Amsterdam fame! This Dutch seedbank has won over 25 cannabis cups with numerous marijuana strains. Well respected throughout the medical marijuana community, paradise pot and weed seeds are available in both female and regular. The female cannabis seeds are all F1 and vigorous, often recommended in Medicinal Marijuana Dispensaries throughout the world.</p><p>Haze plants are getting ever more popular. But in fact it is one of the oldest and classic strains, dating back to the 70&rsquo;s. Today it regains popularity but for the last few decades it had not such a good name. Now that it is back with us, you can find it in many shapes and forms,  most of the times in crossbreds with heavy Indica&rsquo;s to suppress the longer flowering period. After developing our beautiful Delahaze variety a couple of years ago, we thought it would be excellent timing for a typical Haze strain.</p><p>Therefore I would like to introduce to you the Haze bomb Atomical Haze.  This variety contains one part original Haze, which is a combination of several Sativa landraces such as Colombian, Mexican and Thai. One part is an Indian classic and last but not least a sweet Afghan.</p><p>The result is devastating and superb in every way. A good combination of genes. These plants can grow quite tall but not as big and ever continuing as some other Hazes.  Plants are actually quite proportioned and make big sized buds covering the branches with medium sized leaves. Trimming is like picking fruits from a tree, so easy. The Sativa / Haze trait is dominant. But this combination give this plants a taste and high superior to most varieties. The flavour when inhaled is typically sweet and sour, similar to the taste of kiwis, with a fine hazy after-taste in the mouth when exhaled. The plants should be put directly from seed into flowering or when grown a bit longer just a few pots will do with a bit of bending tricks.</p><p>The souring clear high keeps you awake so its better to use during daytime. You will not be able to stop with whistling. Enjoy this legend.</p>"

Suited to any kind of climate flowering kicks off in no more than 30 days from germination. Bred by crossing two cannabis heavyweight strains - Girl Scout Cookies and OG Kush Auto, the result couldnâ€™t be other than a hard-hitting strain with a very special U.S. flavour.</p>\n<p>Cookies Auto does well in chilly climates and short summers, growing surprisingly quickly. Almost in no time, sheâ€™ll turn into a medium-sized bushy plant with a dominant central cola and multiple sets of side branches full of thin and long leaves. Despite being an auto she grows vigorously both sideways and upwards, with lots of open branches that allow for optimal penetration of light and air. The star of the show is definitely her main cola, all thick and resin-packed. However, her side branches also fill with sizeable and resin-coated quality nuggets.</p>"

She was bred from a very special cross: Gorilla x OG Kush Autoflowering.</p>\n<p>Gorilla Auto grows into a medium-sized marijuana plant that will fit into smaller spaces thus making the most of smaller grow spaces. Her bushy structure with long inter-nodal spacing allows air and light to reach every corner of her body, making it less likely for moisture/mould problems to arise. Sheâ€™s got some incredibly beautiful lime-green leaves that end up fully covered in a thick layer of white and sticky resin by the time flowering is finished. In spite of being a full-on auto needing no more than 30 days from sowing to start flowering, her yield has nothing to envy to the one offered by the original feminised version of Gorilla.</p>"

Her dense and spiky buds end the flowering phase fully covered in sticky and shiny trichomes. By watering and feeding her regularly and moderately, sheâ€™ll show her full potential. Trimming the lower branches is recommended as this will allow her to focus all energies on the development of the top and side branches.</p>\n<p>Gorilla CBD has a scent of diesel, like Gorilla, and tastes of Kush, like Dinamed CBD Kush. Tasting her an unbeatable experience accompanied by a rich and strong flavour. Her 14% CBD softens the mind-blowing narcotic effect of the original Gorilla. Hers is a moderate high that will captivate low-THC Kush-flavoured indica-lovers at once. </p>"

Sacred Seeds created it in the late 1970s from Afghani Indica, \"Acapulco Gold\" Mexican Sativa and Columbian Gold Sativa.  For the first time this strain provided growers with the good taste and high of a sativa coupled with the quick heavy flowering of an indica. Having been successfully stabilized, Skunk No. 1 has been widely used as a breeding parent for most of today's leading \"Skunk\" and many other strains. It is very easy to grow and has always been seen as a standard against which others can be measured.  It produces dense buds varying in colour from light green to golden with a very high yield. It is easy to manicure due to its high bud-to-leaf ratio. It has a sweet smell and taste with a cerebral high.</p>"
